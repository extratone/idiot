There was a lot of activity in the Club MacStories+ Discord this week between the release of iOS and iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and the new iPads. Here are a few things that caught our eye that you should check out if you missed them earlier this week:

[Day Planner is a shortcut](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/889848280589164605) that integrates with Obsidian adding ‘BREAK’ between events and ‘END’ when your appointments are finished for the day.

If you’re looking for an easy way to embed tweets and YouTube video in Obsidian, [Simple Embeds is an excellent plugin](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/888059193762938930) created by a Club member.

[Wallpapers is a shortcut](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/890725577554800660) created by a Club member that stores wallpapers for various devices in iCloud and gives you options to switch your wallpaper based on the device from which you run the shortcut.
