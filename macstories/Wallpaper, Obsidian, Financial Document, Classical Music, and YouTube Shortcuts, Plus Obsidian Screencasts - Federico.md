## [Wallpaper, Obsidian, Financial Document, Classical Music, and YouTube Shortcuts, Plus Obsidian Screencasts](https://club.macstories.net/posts/a-wallpaper-obsidian-financial-document-classical-music-and-youtube-shortcuts-plus-obsidian-screencasts)

It was another busy week on the Club MacStories+ Discord, and I’ve tried my best to collect highlights from the community below. There isn’t a Discord URL scheme to reopen these links in the Discord app directly; my preferred approach for these is to view them as separate tabs in Safari for iPad or Mac.

Yesterday, I published the first monthly lesson of the Automation Academy for Club MacStories+ and Club Premier members. This month’s lesson is a deep dive into the Files actions for iOS 15 in which I cover the basics, explain advanced techniques for file management, and share some examples of Files-based shortcuts I’ve put together. You can [read it here](https://club.macstories.net/posts/automation-academy-diving-deeper-into-shortcuts-files-actions-for-ios-and-ipados-15).

Member Anneleen [shared her technique](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/884156557313585282) for setting wallpapers in Shortcuts depending on the system’s light or dark mode, and it’s an ingenious one based on the Photos app.

Discord member Jezza [created an Obsidian clipping shortcut](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/884060050266660865) that lets you easily save YouTube videos as new notes with native media embeds. Jezza also [shared the CSS snippet](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/883972284862312488) they’re using in Obsidian, named ‘Ficus Ruby’.

Speaking of YouTube, member David put together a shortcut for my Automation Academy assignment that [downloads YouTube videos](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/885578816876064809) using [a-Shell](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438) (something I [covered](https://www.macstories.net/linked/downloading-youtube-videos-on-ipad-with-youtube-dl-and-a-shell/) on MacStories before) and saves them into a specific folder. You can [get the shortcut on Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/885588880944934912).

Devon also created a shortcut as an Automation Academy assignment to [organize financial documents into sub-folders](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/885667403361579060). The shortcut takes advantage of the new ‘Get Contents of Folder’ and updated ‘Save File’ and ‘Filter Files’ actions.

In a series of screencasts, member Calhistorian explains the [utility of Obsidian’s graph view](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/884560137178710037) and how it can be a powerful tool to explore and organize your notes.

Apple may be working on a brand new app for classical music following the [acquisition of Primephonic](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic/), but that didn’t stop member Jonathan from creating a shortcut that [reopens the existing Classical section](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/884371106474123274) in Apple Music with one tap.
