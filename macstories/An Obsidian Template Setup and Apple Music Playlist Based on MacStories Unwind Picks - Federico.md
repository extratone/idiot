It was a busy week on the Club MacStories+ Discord, and I’ve tried my best to collect highlights from the community below. There isn’t a Discord URL scheme to reopen these links in the Discord app directly; my preferred approach for these is to view them as separate tabs in Safari for iPad or Mac.

Discord member Jezza has [shared an in-depth look at their Obsidian setup](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/918229425848483850) based on [templates](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/919032187335098409) to capture different kinds of information. It’s a fascinating example of the power of Obsidian and I plan on studying some of these ideas more in depth soon.

Jarrod [made an Apple Music playlist](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346102322659329/918880101624606721) featuring all the songs John and I mentioned on MacStories Unwind.
