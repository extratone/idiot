## [Raindrop's Safari Extension, Daily Notes in Obsidian, a MagSafe Wallet Tip, Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series](https://club.macstories.net/posts/raindrops-safari-extension-daily-notes-in-obsidian-a-magsafe-wallet-tip-isaac-asimovs-foundation-series)

It was a busy week on the Club MacStories+ Discord, and I’ve tried my best to collect highlights from the community below. There isn’t a Discord URL scheme to reopen these links in the Discord app directly; my preferred approach for these is to view them as separate tabs in Safari for iPad or Mac.

I [covered](https://club.macstories.net/posts/app-debuts-294) Raindrop’s excellent Safari extension last week, and now member David has [figured out the shortcut](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345683550765157/899990084164648971) to activate it from an external keyboard in the browser.

Over in the #obsidian channel, I asked members if they could [share examples of how they’re using daily notes](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/900738408979247145) in Obsidian and Craft. I’ve been struggling to understand the advantages of daily notes, and I received some fantastic suggestions I’m going to study and try implementing myself.

If you’re wondering how you can quickly confirm whether a MagSafe wallet you’re purchasing in person is one of the new ones with Find My support, member Rasmus [shared the easiest way to do so](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345643567251506/900825799081484288).

Club member floeem shared [a suggested order for reading Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345854385815652/899784693925441578) of books. For the A.V. Club, which is part of the Club MacStories+ Discord, we’re currently watching the Foundation TV series, which we’ll be discussing the first week of November.
