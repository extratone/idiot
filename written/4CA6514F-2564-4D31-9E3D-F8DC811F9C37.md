    - [Digital Rights as Human Rights]
The continued threat of Big Social’s business model

Tune in for this important conversation featuring unreleased clips from the film.

The Jan. 6th attacks on The U.S. Capitol were fueled by the spread of conspiracy theories, hate, and extremism. While the decision by Big Social to terminate Trump’s accounts and remove groups responsible for the insurrection was a necessary response to help prevent further violence, it is not a long-term solution. It is a band-aid to a problem that many countries beyond the U.S. have been dealing with and activists have been sounding the alarm on for years.

We must now be even more critical of how data is being used by these platforms in ways that continue to amplify bias, incite violence, and fundamentally threaten our human rights. Join us for a discussion examining how a human rights lens can help us imagine the way forward and hold these platforms accountable. 

Panelists include:
Safiya Noble - Author, Algorithms of Oppression 
Jessica Dheere - Director, Ranking Digital Rights 
Rasha Abdul Rahim - Co-Director, Amnesty Tech 
Moderated by: Max Steinman, The Social Dilemma Impact Campaign Director

    - this week, SMCC is a movie club! 

 We are watching the historically rare, singular vision "The Astrologer". It is an an "autobiographical" film based off a never-aired tv series based off a never-published book by Craig Denney, a mysterious millionare, early computer astrologer, and potential death-faker! 

 It's not necessarily going to be good, but it is going to be memorable!

Press 1 for Tech Tips

On Friday Sep 3, 2021 at around 1:45pm PST, we will be tweeting out a toll-free phone number which you can use to call Linus for tech support, for about a two hour window.

But here’s the thing: standing between you and Linus is a funny and frustrating phone-tree that we think you’ll have a blast navigating through, and we want to see your reactions to it! Not only that, we want to include your reactions in our video!

Therefore, we’re asking callers to follow these steps:

  1. hit record on a video of yourself (with audio)
  2. then call in on speakerphone. 
  3. Once your call’s over, upload your video to YouTube with #press1forTechTips in the title (must have!)

The idea here is for our final video to have BOTH footage of you fine folks exploring the phone tree with all it’s wacky paths AND one on one tech support time between you and Linus.

People who aren’t just here for the memes and legitimately need tech support will be asked to leave a voicemail containing their email address. If you’re selected, you will then receive a Google Meet link. It’s probably best to initiate this meeting on your phone so you can easily point the camera at the stuff you need help with :) 

Thanks everyone! We’re really excited to see your reaction videos!

    - iOS 15 & iPadOS 15 are out and there’s so much room to play with Focus modes, custom Home Screens, and widgets on the iPad now too – so let’s work on them together!

I spent WAY too much time on the betas testing these and have tons of tips, recommendations for setups, and apps/shortcuts to share – I totally “get it” so I’d love to help you dive in too!

Join me for the morning and let’s work on them together – leave questions/comments in the chat and submit your Home Screens in the Discord so I can take a look on-stream.

From micro.baer.works/yesterday-i-started-putting-together-an-analysis-of-web3-the-apparent-next
Yesterday I started putting together an analysis of Web3, the apparent next stage of the web, for my personal baer.works site. When I got to the end, I realized I had only outlined my criticisms without proposing anything else. So today I started writing what I think a real “Web 3.0,” in the spirit of the original Web, should be. I ended up with 2,000 words after a few hours.
Hope to publish it tomorrow on write.as/matt.

    - [Digital Rights as Human Rights]
The continued threat of Big Social’s business model

Tune in for this important conversation featuring unreleased clips from the film.

The Jan. 6th attacks on The U.S. Capitol were fueled by the spread of conspiracy theories, hate, and extremism. While the decision by Big Social to terminate Trump’s accounts and remove groups responsible for the insurrection was a necessary response to help prevent further violence, it is not a long-term solution. It is a band-aid to a problem that many countries beyond the U.S. have been dealing with and activists have been sounding the alarm on for years.

We must now be even more critical of how data is being used by these platforms in ways that continue to amplify bias, incite violence, and fundamentally threaten our human rights. Join us for a discussion examining how a human rights lens can help us imagine the way forward and hold these platforms accountable. 

Panelists include:
Safiya Noble - Author, Algorithms of Oppression 
Jessica Dheere - Director, Ranking Digital Rights 
Rasha Abdul Rahim - Co-Director, Amnesty Tech 
Moderated by: Max Steinman, The Social Dilemma Impact Campaign Director

    - this week, SMCC is a movie club! 

 We are watching the historically rare, singular vision "The Astrologer". It is an an "autobiographical" film based off a never-aired tv series based off a never-published book by Craig Denney, a mysterious millionare, early computer astrologer, and potential death-faker! 

 It's not necessarily going to be good, but it is going to be memorable!

Press 1 for Tech Tips

On Friday Sep 3, 2021 at around 1:45pm PST, we will be tweeting out a toll-free phone number which you can use to call Linus for tech support, for about a two hour window.

But here’s the thing: standing between you and Linus is a funny and frustrating phone-tree that we think you’ll have a blast navigating through, and we want to see your reactions to it! Not only that, we want to include your reactions in our video!

Therefore, we’re asking callers to follow these steps:

  1. hit record on a video of yourself (with audio)
  2. then call in on speakerphone. 
  3. Once your call’s over, upload your video to YouTube with #press1forTechTips in the title (must have!)

The idea here is for our final video to have BOTH footage of you fine folks exploring the phone tree with all it’s wacky paths AND one on one tech support time between you and Linus.

People who aren’t just here for the memes and legitimately need tech support will be asked to leave a voicemail containing their email address. If you’re selected, you will then receive a Google Meet link. It’s probably best to initiate this meeting on your phone so you can easily point the camera at the stuff you need help with :) 

Thanks everyone! We’re really excited to see your reaction videos!

From micro.baer.works/yesterday-i-started-putting-together-an-analysis-of-web3-the-apparent-next
Yesterday I started putting together an analysis of Web3, the apparent next stage of the web, for my personal baer.works site. When I got to the end, I realized I had only outlined my criticisms without proposing anything else. So today I started writing what I think a real “Web 3.0,” in the spirit of the original Web, should be. I ended up with 2,000 words after a few hours.
Hope to publish it tomorrow on write.as/matt.

- Change to find/replace regular expression configuration to support replacement of positive lookahead constructs.

*19-01-2022 00:19* 

> Listen to music by Big K.R.I.T. on Apple Music. Find top songs and albums by Big K.R.I.T. including 1Train (feat. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Bada$$, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson & Big K.R.I.T.), Addiction (feat. Lil Wayne & Saweetie) and more.
Big K.R.I.T. became one of the South's most promising talents in the 2010s by bringing earnest self-reflection, trunk-rattling bass, and youthful energy to a consistently underestimated Southern rap scene. Born Justin Scott in 1986, K.R.I.T. is from impoverished Meridian, Mississippi, a no man's land for commercial hip-hop but a hotspot for rich experiences and personalities. After tinkering with production equipment in his grandmother's kitchen, he released *K.R.I.T. Wuz Here* in 2010. It would prove to be a stunning mixtape, earning him comparisons to T.I. and Pimp C with its soulful beats and deft raps delivered with a charming Southern drawl. Soon after, he became an instant blog darling with more free album-quality projects. His 2012 major-label debut, *Live from the Underground*, served as a satisfying stew of Southern heritage, conceptual ambition, and old-soul spirituality. On it, he idolizes his speakers on "My Sub, Pt. 2: The Jackin'" and imagines slave life on the B.B. King collaboration "Praying Man." For his 2014 follow-up, *Cadillactica*, he welcomed outside producers like Jim Jonsin and Raphael Saadiq, which brought a new depth to his signature sound. By 2017, K.R.I.T. was indie and released double-disc *4eva Is a Mighty Long Time*, once again wielding his usual techniques to reflect on his flashy, strip club-frequenting rapper persona on one side and vulnerable cuts about love and religion on the other. As the game steadily changes around him, K.R.I.T. merely cements what uplifted him to rap royalty—or better yet, a King Remembered In Time.

    - # "Big K.R.I.T. on Apple Music"

*19-01-2022 00:19* 

> Listen to music by Big K.R.I.T. on Apple Music. Find top songs and albums by Big K.R.I.T. including 1Train (feat. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Bada$$, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson & Big K.R.I.T.), Addiction (feat. Lil Wayne & Saweetie) and more.
Big K.R.I.T. became one of the South's most promising talents in the 2010s by bringing earnest self-reflection, trunk-rattling bass, and youthful energy to a consistently underestimated Southern rap scene. Born Justin Scott in 1986, K.R.I.T. is from impoverished Meridian, Mississippi, a no man's land for commercial hip-hop but a hotspot for rich experiences and personalities. After tinkering with production equipment in his grandmother's kitchen, he released *K.R.I.T. Wuz Here* in 2010. It would prove to be a stunning mixtape, earning him comparisons to T.I. and Pimp C with its soulful beats and deft raps delivered with a charming Southern drawl. Soon after, he became an instant blog darling with more free album-quality projects. His 2012 major-label debut, *Live from the Underground*, served as a satisfying stew of Southern heritage, conceptual ambition, and old-soul spirituality. On it, he idolizes his speakers on "My Sub, Pt. 2: The Jackin'" and imagines slave life on the B.B. King collaboration "Praying Man." For his 2014 follow-up, *Cadillactica*, he welcomed outside producers like Jim Jonsin and Raphael Saadiq, which brought a new depth to his signature sound. By 2017, K.R.I.T. was indie and released double-disc *4eva Is a Mighty Long Time*, once again wielding his usual techniques to reflect on his flashy, strip club-frequenting rapper persona on one side and vulnerable cuts about love and religion on the other. As the game steadily changes around him, K.R.I.T. merely cements what uplifted him to rap royalty—or better yet, a King Remembered In Time.
