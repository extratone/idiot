Twitter is now allowing hosts of Twitter Spaces chats to record and share their broadcasts. The feature is starting to roll out to a limited number of Twitter Spaces hosts on iOS and should be available to all hosts “within a few weeks.” The feature lets hosts record a Twitter Spaces conversation and share the recording in a tweet.

The new functionality also means that anyone who was late to a Twitter Spaces broadcast will now be able to replay the broadcast once it’s finished if a host has enabled recording. That means tweets that are typically shared to promote Twitter Spaces broadcasts will now include a link to a recording, rather than a note that the Spaces broadcast has ended.

Participants will be notified with a new icon that a recording is taking place when they join a live Twitter Spaces broadcast. Hosts will then have access to recordings for 30 days after the broadcast for sharing purposes, or they can decide to delete a Spaces recording at any time. [Twitter says](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces) it will keep recordings up to 120 days to check for any abusive or hateful content.

The new recording option comes just a week after Twitter [opened up Spaces to all iOS and Android users](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces). Twitter is also testing a new Spaces tab for its Clubhouse competitor, has [created a fund](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724450/twitter-spaces-accelerator-spark-clubhouse-creators) for creators, and is even piloting [ticketed Spaces audio rooms](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test) that you pay a fee to participate in.
