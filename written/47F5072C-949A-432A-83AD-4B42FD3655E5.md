# Savage Grace
Accompany me with your night
to our hideaway from *pleasant surprise*

Glide me through what trees you give
move’d about striding cruel stream

I am yours to reflect
and bear with noble assumptions
to reciprocally know across our
existential divide

to divulge few precious
cross-corridor smiles
to know with only a rhythmic zest
a favorite name

Such designed convergence!
Such intentful patience!
My escape in heavy air
accepting as last heir
to your
sanctuary of apathy
or so it seems in our newborn night
lit by nearly-familiar intermittent tower lights
to reveal a way devoid of purposeless reciprocation
remind me occasionally,
but not this night

To hum the music and dance in your
beautiful retreat with the voice
of a coincidence
of a comfort
of a pinnacle
seen in sunlight one more time
over the hedge
by old plotting eyes
that wonder’d
in dignified legacy
It was a shame

The voice of my dancer
sustains necessary function to indulge
our wary dark dabbling

Too occupied to sound off
for warmth in kind that is
appropriately distanced
in disgust
without fail,
instinctually instantaneously

Briskly striding through the blackness
without complaint
or its language,
paced by ancient intuition

Ye sure-footed sage
Ye lethal lunar predator
Killing as serenity obscured by
silence’s sleepy wool

Stitched and bound by effort’s promise

Visible only as correct form to voluntarily carry
noble titles
through nostalgic undulations

Love yourself and go away
Tenses meander and play
through a churning human sea
The taxation of diligence
for a reserve that could never
be objectively respectable
(nor profane)
It smooths habitual language
to their most
dependably honed state
