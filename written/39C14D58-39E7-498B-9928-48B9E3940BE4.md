If you’re a fan of [Twitter](/life/article/twitter-safety-factsheet), then you know that you rely on your followers for retweets, mentions, and more followers just as much as they follow you to view your content. But what if your followers want to know more about you, and you’d like to answer their questions?

Curious Cat quickly gained popularity for that exact reason.

Curious Cat is a free, small-scale social networking tool that allows you to connect with your followers by providing them with the appropriate tools to communicate with you, and you back to them, either anonymously or publicly. It is a question and answer system that allows people to ask you questions.

### How does it work?

By signing into your Twitter account through the Curious Cat website ([curiouscat.me](https://www.curiouscat.me)), you have the ability to post questions anonymously or publicly to someone that can be answered by that person. You can also “confess” something through Curious Cat, either posting as your Twitter account or as an anonymous user. When you confess something to another user, though, that user can’t reply back. You can also follow other people through Curious Cat. Through your feed, you can view published questions/answers and confessions. By receiving notifications, you can see if someone asked you a question, where you’ll have the option to reply.

You can share your curiouscat.me profile and let your followers know when you’re online and are free to chat. When someone talks to you, their name will appear under the send-message box. Press “Enter” or a similar button to reply to them.

While talking to your followers and answering their questions might be fun, you may not want what you say to each other to be published on your Twitter page in case you’re worried about flooding your other followers, or if you want to keep a question or confession private. You get to decide whether something is published to Twitter or not.

### What else can I do with it?

Along with responding to questions, you can also respond with pictures to your curious follower. Other than that, it’s a pretty basic communication tool used mainly to answer or ask questions, or say what’s on your mind.

## What are the risks with Curious Cat?

With any social media communication website, there’s the chance that cyberbullying or digital abuse can happen. Curious Cat provide information on [blocking and reporting](https://curiouscat.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002649832-Blocking-Reporting) on the help section of their website to prevent them from being able to message you again and potentially removing them from the platform.

### Should I sign up for Curious Cat?

If you see this as an interesting and fun opportunity to learn new information about the people you follow, or you feel the need to let something out that you haven’t been able to before, that’s awesome. This website might absolutely benefit you. 

However, if you fear the chance of anonymous bullying, then this might be a pass. If you decide to give it a go, be sure to post and respond thoughtfully. Remember that there’s a person on the other side of the screen who could get hurt. Don’t share your private information to the public for your personal safety!
