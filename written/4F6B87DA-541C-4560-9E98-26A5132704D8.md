# Icons & “Themes”

![Themes & Icons - Twitter Blue for iOS](https://i.snap.as/935pp2QS.png)

Even greater heights of half-assery have been achieved by what Twitter describes as “[exclusive app icons and colorful themes](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-smarter--twitter-harder-with-twitter-blue).” Here, I must finally give in and compare Twitter Blue with Tweetbot directly.

Absolutely zero effort has been expended thus far in recharacterizing what Web Twitter still calls “Colors” as “Themes,” and the only *exclusivity* in the icon options is that some are seasonal, or otherwise time-limited, for what possible purpose I cannot conceive. This from a company of more than 5000 full-time employees. 

In contrast, from a full-time team of two - both of whom suffered through bad COVID infections, this year - Tweetbot now includes an even further broadened spectrum of app-wide themes and 19 app icons in total, including, yes, at least two very cute, limited-time seasonal options.
