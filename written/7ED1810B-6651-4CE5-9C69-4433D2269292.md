# The Fate of Textor
I'd come across mention of it multiple times throughout this whole thing - an app that was described repeatedly as "[the iOS equivalent of TextEdit](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/textor-the-ios-equivalent-of-textedit-integrated-with-files/)," and - from what I can tell - the only software that has ever been able to actually edit text files on an iPhone. That headline is more than enough to warrant you immediately clicking the first App Store link you come across, right?
