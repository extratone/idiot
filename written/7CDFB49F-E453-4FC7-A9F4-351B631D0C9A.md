# Underbluff
I drove my truck to the valley with a forty

I found a little peace
I found a little respite,
as had many before me

And itâ€™s in such an affection
that I lay

And I thanked,
habitually
In particular,
nobody

And I remember the family
in a similar state
speaking old words of past lovers
that had *let themselves go*

Perhaps, only in that moment,
I wished them well

===

Stirred sparrow storm
Where are your keenest words?
Where is your golden drum?
Could there be a man less burdened that I,
with my unscrupulous song?
