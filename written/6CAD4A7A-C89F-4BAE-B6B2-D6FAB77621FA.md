# 1994 Dodge Caravan thoughts

come to think of it, I would call it The Most Significant American Automobile of My Generation. https://youtu.be/OqJn4wAhmFI

1994: 3419 lbs.
2020: 4,321 to 4,483 lbs.

well, I think I definitely would've talking about weight considering the 2020 Caravan's base curb weight is ~an even 1000 lbs. greater than in 1994, which is uh… a lot.

disregarding the legal/legislative component of this and instead focusing on the supposed justification behind it…

we'd say it's okay the 2020 model is a whole grand heavier because it's *that much safer*, primarily, right? and then justification #2 would revolve around how much more technology is packed into the segment in 2020. 

but just fucking think about how much less fuel/tires/brake pads would've been consumed and carbons emitted if we'd sacrificed less to the safety ideal in the past 27 years and kept the weight about the same…

I really hope this trend of getting bigger and heavier is going to end sometime soon because if it doesn't…
