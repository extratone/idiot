Hey guys, I actually have a time sensitive and quite consequential hardware/setup question.

My girlfriend is a third grade teacher at a public elementary school here in mid-Missouri, and her 2023 school year is going to start in 8 days.

||I'm going to assume you're all smarter/more observant than me, but... I am ashamed to confess that I had *absolutely no idea* just how integrated iPads have become in elementary school education in an extremely consequential way. The past week has been... Extremely alarming, but that's not relevant to my question sorry.||

Each of her 25 children will be getting a 32GB, fifth-generation iPad (`iPad6,11`) that they sometimes take home I guess? But she will be responsible for storing, dispensing, charging, and regularly transporting (as in, between classroom and the "media center") all of them.

I have been asked to address the issue of storing and transporting them, specifically, and I thought the challenge might be a potentially enjoyable one to engage with. I've attached a single example of what another teacher has come up with (as well as an image of one of the half dozen or so?? piles of devices ||(none of which have been updated beyond 15.1 yet!!!!)|| to give you some idea of the scale of what these teachers are dealing with.)

Thanks in advance for your time. I uh.... need assistance lmao.
