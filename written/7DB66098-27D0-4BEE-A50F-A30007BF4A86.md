here it is at MAX SPEED to demonstrate what I mean. (exiting without pointing the new bookmark to a different collection or adding any tags is accomplished by immediately hitting `ESC`) pic.twitter.com/oeejyT8B26

oh btw a sincere congratulations and thanks to ‪@raindrop_io‬ ‪@exentrich‬ for *actually* achieving what so many have tried and failed to do: you have completely replaced my need to use Safari’s native Reading List (`⌘ + ⇧ + D`) EVER AGAIN in making this just as fast. BRAVO.

especially if I were still writing a weekly newsletter, this single keyboard keyboard shortcut would be justifying my use of Safari over any other web browser on iOS. which is crazy because guess how many non-Safari browsers I have on my phone right now? NINE.

I originally dismissed this until I accidentally discovered the Bluetooth keyboard shortcut. `⌘ + ⇧ + E` what you can’t see in this video: keyboard nav in the extension is also supported more than it is anywhere else in Raindrop lol. pic.twitter.com/XJXmSx0bnq pic.twitter.com/XJXmSx0bnq #keys
