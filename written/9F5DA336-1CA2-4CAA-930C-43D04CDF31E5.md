alright so let me just acknowledge the spectrum of arguments on this issue real quick... I hear you, mmkay, BUT... yes, there would be nothing better than if good ole Jeff could just write a $100 billion check or something and just "end world hunger." https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/jeff-bezos-world-hunger-twitter-account/

in fact, I BET U so much immediate general improvement of humanity's condition would be an immediate (even enthusiastic) YES if it seemed at all graspable. 
Ã‚
of course, all I know about Jeff is that I ALSO LOVE U, ALIVE GIRL, but yeah, I can't imagine he's altogether pleasant. probably both more and less foul than whatever image we have of him in our heads.

HOWEVER... what I'm sayin is that EVEN THE WORST PSYCHOPATH WOULD SAY YES FOR SELFISH REASONS if they were at all cognitively present because the extent of his worth is such that even the MOST evil motherfucker wouldn't be able to reasonably justify alternative expenditure.
