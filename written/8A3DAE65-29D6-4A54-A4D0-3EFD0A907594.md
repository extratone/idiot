# How to Extract Images from Webarchive Files Using Terminal

https://www.icloud.com/notes/0749MgKoLapL1mUmV6I3gdKpQ#Extracting_content_from_.webarchive_files_with_Terminal

One way to extract the images from the .webarchive file is through the Terminal app. Here’s how.

1 – First, press Command and space on the keyboard to launch Spotlight, type in “Terminal” and hit Enter. That’ll open the Terminal app.

2 – Then type in this command without hitting Enter. Note there is a space at the end after “html”. 

`textutil -convert html`

3 – Lastly, drag the .webarchive file into Terminal. Hit Enter and you’ll find all the extracted files in the same folder where the .webarchive file is located.
