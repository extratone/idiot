# "Announcing List lookup endpoints for the Twitter API v2 - Announcements - Twitter Developers" 

The Twitter API v2 is ready for prime time! Over the past 14 months, we have been steadily releasing net new and v1.1 replacement endpoints to Twitter API v2, and today 90% of all existing apps built on the Twitter API v1.1 can be fully supported on v2 with new key features and increased access.

##  Twitter API v2 overview to-date

If you’re new to Twitter API v2, here are a few highlights of what we’ve released to-date:

##  Today’s launch

And today, we are adding the following updates to the list:

  * Fast and free Essential access ([sign up](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info)) to the API, and free Elevated access to developers who have had their use cases approved. We have more details on these access levels in our [About Twitter API guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level), and later in this post.
  * We are removing language in our Developer Policy that restricted how you build with Twitter’s core features, and limited the number of users you can support through your app. 
    * We are opening up our platform to encourage you to build tools and products that make Twitter better, healthier, and extend the public conversation. [See a list of solutions we’d love to see you build](https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/build-for-consumers).
    * Specifically, we’ve removed terms that restricted replication of the Twitter experience, including Twitter’s core features as well as terms that required permission to have high numbers of user tokens.
    * We know that building solutions that help people on Twitter often means a developer has to build (or replicate) some of the things that are available on Twitter. These changes to our Developer Policy are intended to drive clarity for the developer ecosystem and provide an open API platform that makes it easier for developers to build, innovate, and make an impact on the public conversation.
  * We’re adding [new functionality to the Spaces endpoints](https://twittercommunity.com/t/adding-new-functionality-to-spaces-endpoints/161959). 
    * Creators can look up the list of people who purchased a ticket to their Spaces. This list returns full user objects and is available only when the request is made by the creator of a ticketed Space.
    * The Space object now returns topics associated with a Space, as well as the end time of an ended Space.
  * We’re [completing the v2 Lists endpoint group](https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-list-lookup-endpoints-for-the-twitter-api-v2/161965) today with the addition of a variety of different GET Lists endpoints. 
    * These endpoints will enable users to build solutions that solve for curation, discoverability, and analysis needs.
    * New [List object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/lists) returned with many of the endpoints.
    * New functionality to the group that allows developers to lookup user’s pinned Lists.

We do still plan to release updated versions of the Direct Messages, trends, media, and geo endpoints soon. You can see a list of how the v1.1 endpoints map to our v2 replacements in our [endpoint map guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/twitter-api-endpoint-map), and can follow along via our [product roadmap](https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-developer-platform-roadmap).

Also, for those with a need for **access beyond 2M Tweets/month**, or **who need advanced reliability and scale features** like redundancy and larger caps on search requests, please [join our waitlist](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/elevated-waitlist) to receive updates about our future product plans for access beyond Elevated. If you need greater access immediately, please consider our [enterprise APIs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/enterprise).

For those of you who are currently in a managed relationship with our team and using enterprise APIs today, you can read a separate FAQ to help you understand how we plan to support you as we continue to build v2.

And a final note on upcoming plans: We’re working on a solution to enable developers whose previous applications for a developer account have been declined. We’ll share a path soon to enable sign up for Essential, or to re-apply for Elevated access.

* * *

##  Are you new to the platform and ready to get started?

We encourage you to [sign up for Essential access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info) and [make your first request](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/make-your-first-request) to the API.

Once you sign up, you will have a project with Essential access within your account which will provide you with the following:

  * 1 App environment
  * The ability to retrieve up to [500k Tweets per month](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps)
  * The ability to use up to 5 rules with the filtered stream endpoint
  * Access to the majority of the Twitter API v2 endpoints
  * You will not be able to access the [standard v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1), [premium v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium), or [enterprise](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise) endpoints

If you need more access than this, you can [apply for Elevated access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated).

##  How about those of you that are already on the platform?

If you’ve already been approved for a developer account, your Standard Project will automatically be converted to a Project with Elevated access, which will now provide you with the following:

  * [NEW] Up to 3 [App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) environments (development, staging, and production)
  * [NEW] The ability to retrieve up to [2 million Tweets per month](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps)
  * Access to the majority of Twitter API v2 endpoints
  * The ability to use up to 25 rules with [filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/introduction)
  * Access to [standard v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1), [premium v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium), and [enterprise](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise) endpoints
  * Access to [team functionality](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal/team-management) to provide and manage your teammates access to your project

If you are an academic researcher, you may continue to be served by Academic Research access to the API v2. Learn more on the [Academic Research page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research).

For those of you that have already been using the platform, we’ve put together a [migration hub](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/overview) to help you learn more about what’s new on the platform and how to update your integration to v2. We’ve also produced migration guides for each v2 endpoint that you can find within their respective section.

##  Ready to build?

Head to our documentation to learn more about what’s available. We also have tutorials that can help you get started with different tools and use cases.

We particularly want to encourage new innovation and growth around a few areas that we believe can have the greatest impact on the world, and on Twitter. You can read more about each of these on our [‘what to build’ page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/what-to-build).

  * Improve the health and safety of the public conversation (through moderation and more)
  * Curate and recommend content
  * Help people create, express themselves, and engage with one another
  * Make it easier for people around the world to converse no matter their language or location
  * Help people measure, analyze, and find insights within the public conversation
  * Support the public good

  * [Samir Al-Battran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0fkwEFQKtw&list=PLFKjcMIU2Wsg6pNvUcFSyqfxIM_RSg8a4), built a business out of [Tweetsmap](https://tweepsmap.com/)
  * [Stein Monteiro](https://developer.twitter.com/en/community/success-stories/cerc-academic-research), a researcher understanding Twitter’s impact on the farming protests in India
  * [Black Swan Data](https://www.blackswan.com/) enables brands to build product innovation programs by identifying, connecting, and predicting emerging consumer trends.
  * Dan Rowden added a Spaces analytics dashboard to [ilo](https://ilo.so)
