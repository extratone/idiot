## Query a specified Tot Dot’s line, word, and character counts + modified date.

This shortcut uses the new actions present in Iconfactory’s [Tot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483) and [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191) to query a Dot specified by number at run for all available metadata: line count, word count, character count, and modification date. It will also offer the option to append the information in the format below to the end of said Dot.

```
**Dot: Dot Info (Dot Number)**
- Lines: Dot Info (Line Count)
- Words: Dot Info (Word Count)
- Characters: Dot Info (Character Count)
- Modified: Dot Info (Modification Date)
```
