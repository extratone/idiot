Lately it’s been difficult to find adequate distraction, I’ve actually become disenchanted with the internet in particular which is part of why I was so enthusiastic about your site. I had been a bit worried about the inclusion of that sentiment- the not-caring- because that kind of casual negativity can make for a good repellant. Anyway yes! I love your site! Both the content and the.. “features” (that word makes me want to gag). I haven’t had enough time to go through it as much as I’d like but I’m looking forward to doing so. Hypothesis is so cool, people are missing out.

~Apology Interlude~ I feel like I’m either loquacious or laconic and never the proper amount in between and if you are finding that to be the case I am sorry, my communication skills have really eroded.

I enjoyed reading that interview, a lot of what you said resonated with me, especially the issue of consolidating interests.

RegEx is fun!! You can do it!! I really want to make a syntax that’s similar to markdown in that it’s a kind of shorthand that gets compiled into something else, just for fun. I just realised that before I even had much of an idea of what markdown was I was already using it, in a way. I was heavily involved in an IRC server a few years ago and a component of that server is a custom syntax which one can use to publish webpages, for example a pipe preceding an image url creates <img> markup upon publication. That’s the sort of thing I want to try.

I have at least three tabs from Tim’s webpage open on my computer, I really like his journaling related actions.

Ah thank you, that’s kind of you to say. What would you say your medium is, then? I haven’t shot 110, no, I was actually under the impression it had been discontinued but I see now that I was wrong, which is great. I’d love to take the cameras off of your hands, but only if you’re certain. They could be good motivation to take pictures again, I’m always toying with the idea while simultaneously lamenting that it is “too late.” My main gripe with photography is that I think photos of people are usually more interesting that photos of other subjects but, for a variety of factors, I’ve only ever had myself to use as a model (apart from a few rare occasions) which is frustrating and feels limiting.

My address is:

Rebecca Williams
409 W. 38th St
Apt 305
Austin, TX
78705-1348

As an aside, I accidentally imported your vcf and noticed that it immediately makes your address known. I’ve had mine [here](http://jollo.org/LNT/home/thorns/trash/mail.html) for ages and have not known anyone else (but I’m sure they’re out there!) as casual about it.. until now.

Sorrythiswassolongandsentwithoutanykindofproofreading.

That last sentence! Oof! I feel it. I’ve been unable to care about things like I used to for 7 years now and have definitely constructed an elaborate series of distractions (including configuration, no doubt) to keep myself occupied. I have to say - your reply is the sort one fantasizes about getting in reaction to something like The Psalms, but doesn’t expect. *Nobody* has every said anything about Hypothesis. You have delighted me very much.

As far as syntaxes go, I, too discovered Markdown pretty late in life. These days, I usually [tell people it saved my life](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue). In Drafts, I stay in MultiMarkdown - though I have all the syntaxes in the Directory (my install is basically a mirror of the Directory at this point lol) - mostly because of the way fonts are rendered. It’s hard to explain but if you try the others, you’ll see it. I have wanted to [develop my own Drafts Syntax](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/development/syntax-format) for a long time, but it remains the one bit of Drafts development completely out of my grasp, largely because I do not understand Regex in the slightest lol. Tim Nahumck - who you should definitely [read](https://nahumck.me/?s=drafts) on your Drafts Journey - made [Draftsdown](https://actions.getdrafts.com/s/1hm), which is the most apt candidate to replace MultiMarkdown imo.

I explored your photography! You have reminded me in a big way how capture can be expressive, and how much more intimate such expression is, fundamentally, than that within the medium I’m relegated to. I can’t remember the last time poking around a website of photosets got me to stop everything and actually *see* instead of just looking. It was stirring. That said, I have a question. Have you ever had the opportunity to shoot in 110? Somewhere in my stuff I have two quite pristine Minolta 110 cameras - one of which I managed to find in *actually new* condition and have never used. It’s the same model as the camera in [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbVvUc0lxAv). Minolta did this line of cameras in the late 70s-80s under the marque “Weathermatic.” They’re bright yellow and water/shock resistant. When I lived in Portland, I briefly indulged the idea of becoming the world’s foremost Weathermatic collector but it didn’t last long lol. I also have the 35mm, which isn’t quite as cute, but [makes for a pretty great point-and-shoot](https://www.flickr.com/gp/davidblue/86gn6Y).

Anyway, I was just thinking: assuming I can find them, I would very much like to send you these cameras, if you’d be interested. You’d be doing me a favor - their remaining function in my life is only to make me feel guilty for not using them. It’s been like 3 years, now.

i've actually found myself moving away from Spark back to web-based clients because seeing all of the emails from all of my accounts aggregated in one place like that is, quite frankly, terrifying! i am in the early stages of Drafts Addiction and loving every minute of it. i find myself sneaking away to the bathroom at work so i can lock myself in a stall and work on actions and such.. there are few greater joys in life than c o n f i g u r i n g if you ask me. what is your Drafts syntax of choice? once upon a time i scoffed at markdown but now i've realised the error of my ways and delight in the pleasures of multimarkdown.

thank you! not to be obsequious but your website is a dream. i highlighted something on the page and was stunned to see a hypothesis popover. "Apple Rag" is so amusingly apt; your posts remind me of the things i used to be interested in before i stopped being interested in everything, it's real nice.

I’ve spent too much time c o n f i g u r i n g this year and basically don’t know what else to do, now, beyond talking/writing about what I’ve configured lol.
