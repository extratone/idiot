# TextExpander for iOS/iPadOS Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts
#Keys #TextExpander #iOS #iPadOS

Several keyboard shortcuts are supported when used with an external hardware keyboard, like a Bluetooth keyboard, including the following.

This applies when using TextExpander in the TextExpander app, or any app with built-in TextExpander support. This will not work when using the TextExpander custom keyboard. Third-party keyboards do not have access to use Bluetooth hardware keyboards.

- ⌘Return : When expanding a fill-in snippet, this will complete the expansion the same as tapping Done.
- ⌘N : create a new snippet, Snippet Group, or note.
- ⌘T : switch between the Notes and Snippet Groups screens.
- ⌘+, ⌘- : Will increase or decrease the size of selected text.
- Arrow up, Arrow Down : Navigate through a list of snippets or notes.
- Escape : When expanding a fill-in snippet, this will cancel the expansion.
