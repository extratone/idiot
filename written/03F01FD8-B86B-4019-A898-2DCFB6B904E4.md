# The State of Notetaking With Git Integration on iOS
_This was originally intended as a response to [a post on the Obsidian forums](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-github-integration-for-sync-and-version-control/6369), but apparently it included too many hyperlinks for one's post there, so trying to post it got my account suspended. (lol)_

Regarding Git on iOS, I just wanted to pop in and and share [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) since it wasn't mentioned. 

I've spent the past eight or nine months playing around with Git as integrated into the entirety of my writing/notetaking/curating/documenting process. ([here's the primary subject repo](https://github.com/extratone/bilge), if you're curious, but there's nothing particularly special about anything I've done with it so far.)

in the past three months, especially, this has involved working more on my new iPhone than I have since community college, when my iPhone 4 was my only computer for three semesters. (*that* is a good story lol)

I think I have a fairly good picture of Git on iOS, specifically, after all the reading and testing (screwing around) I've done.

here are the bullet points:
* for a brief period between 2017 and Fall, 2018, there was finally a text editor with relatively non-janky integration with Files called [**Textor**](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/textor-the-ios-equivalent-of-textedit-integrated-with-files/).
* Textor was [removed from the app store](https://twitter.com/louisdhauwe/status/1052003267612299266) when its developer was hired by Apple in [October of 2018](https://github.com/louisdh/textor/issues/27).
* Brett Terpstra's [excellent database of text editors](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/) currently lists three as having integration with Files: [Paper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paper-writing-app/id1476984841), [Pretext](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pretext/id1347707000), and [Writemator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/writemator/id1326574914). (Haven't tried any of them yet, though.)  

Personally, I would rather go through the hassle to write in Bear and export to Working Copy every once in a while than any other workflow I've found yet because I love how both apps look and work, but maybe I'm just superficial lol.
