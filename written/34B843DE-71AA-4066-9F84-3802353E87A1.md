# "r/iphone - What are some little known iPhone hacks?" 
``
I’m sure this gets posted every once in awhile but I’m wondering if there are any new hidden tips and tricks anyone has discovered. I’ll go first. You can get Picture in Picture for YouTube videos if you use Firefox on desktop mode. It will also keep playing if you turn off the screen. Not sure if people have known that hack for awhile but I just learned about it and it’s been great for multitasking. Anyone else?
