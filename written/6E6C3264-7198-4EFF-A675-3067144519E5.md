Howdy folks! I'm new here, and I realize it might be presumptutous to start a thread like this one as my first, but I wanted to both establish a place to continue related, ongoing updates as well as give a general heads up.

Using external keyboards with iPhone has sortof become "[my thing"](https://uikeycommand.com) over the past two years or so, but I've actively done so since support was first introduced. Having played a bit with the first two Developer Betas of iOS 16, I felt more comepelled to speak up regarding its potential impact for iPhone Keyboarders than I have for any other numbered release in memory.

- First, a single positive! It [appears](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1533968485998534661) the Mission Control (Function-3) key will trigger the App Switching view, going forward.
