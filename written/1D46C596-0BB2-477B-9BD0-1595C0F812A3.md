# Bluetooth Keyboard Considerations on iPhone in iOS 15
### Hardware
* iPhone 12 Pro Max MG953LL/A
* MAGIC KEYBOARD WITH NUM KEYPAD SG-USA
MRMH2LL/A
## 1. Unexpected response to Bluetooth Keyboard Inputs 1
With the cursor in a text entry field, the keyboard switches to a mode in which unmodified inputs respond as though they are modified with âŒ˜. I have not yet been able to determine the trigger for this error to reproduce it but I will update this document if/when I do.
