You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't wanna hurt you, but I need to breathe
At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

Which way is right, which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're headed separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's, oh, so much that you deserve
Nothing to say, nothing to do
I've nothing to give, I must live without you
You know we're heading separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

So I'll be on my way

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing that I can really say
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

So I'll be on my way

So I'll be on my way
