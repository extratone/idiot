Apple today pushed out new versions of iOS, watchOS, and tvOS to coincide with the launch of [macOS Monterey](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/macos-12-monterey-the-ars-technica-review/).

iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 most notably add SharePlay, a flagship feature intended for iOS 15 that didn't make the annual release's launch last month.

SharePlay is the name of Apple's suite of features allowing the consumption of content with other callers in a FaceTime call, like watching synchronized streams of Apple TV+ shows and Apple Fitness+ workouts. There's also an API to allow third-party applications to offer the same features.

The update additionally brings ProRes video-capture support to the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max—another feature that missed the initial launch window.

Other additions include the ability to store proof of COVID-19 vaccination in the Wallet app, a toggle for automatic camera switching when taking macro photos, and several bug fixes.

Here are the full release notes for iOS 15.1:

> iOS 15.1 adds SharePlay, an entirely new way to have shared experiences with family and friends in FaceTime. This release also adds the ability to capture ProRes video using iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, as well as verifiable COVID-19 vaccination cards in Apple Wallet, and includes other features and bug fixes for your iPhone.

Apple also launched watchOS 8.1, which mostly fixes bugs but which also adds the same COVID-19 proof-of-vaccination feature we just saw in iOS. It also includes support for SharePlay on Fitness+ content.

Likewise, tvOS 15.1 is a minor update that fixes bugs and implements SharePlay support in tandem with iOS.

All three updates should be available globally to most users on supported devices today.
