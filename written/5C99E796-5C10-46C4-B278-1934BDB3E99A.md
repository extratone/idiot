# LinkedIn Assment Commentary

hello again, you Super Adults. I know I have no business posting here but I promise I’ll be brief.

I wanted to try LinkedIn Assessments to see if they might have the potential to finally fulfill the longstanding fantasy among the Big Blue-ish mfs: a centralized standard of assesment. anywho, I would have almost certainly been in the world’s top 100 if there existed an assessment on Microsoft Word, specifically (I have been dreaming about this my whole life.) I love so much that I’ve invested so much emotional energy and so darn many of my finite eye->digital display hours looking  

but WordPress was the next best thing and uh…

I have no idea what just happened. I understand why the questions I just answered almost all had something to do with good practices, but I know for an actual fact that every single active WP dev among you would’ve had to look up the majority of them. Actually, not *had to,*… Notably, in an actual professional setting, you should have had the documentation in front of you (even if you never need to glance once,) because *memory games are literally pointless outside of academia*.

What I’m trying to say: the assesment I just took on WordPress failed 100% in its (ever more tme-sensitive and desperately needed) duty to explore and grasp 

I just earned a skill badge for WordPress! Who's next? See how you do on a #LinkedInSkillAssessment.
