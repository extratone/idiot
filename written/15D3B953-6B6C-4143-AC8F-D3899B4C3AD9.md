extratone | I feel that.                                                                                                                                                                              │ dzwdz
extratone | malvarma, yes about Blink. I was talking about a reply on Mastodon but if you truly do want to be sought out for editor work, I can do so.                                                │ ellie
extratone | ... but I can't think of a single instance where it wouldn't be a job you should not do for free.                                                                                         │ elly

 malvarma | well extratone if it's a few pages or less, and it helps an open source project, or even just spreads the word about tildes and the like, i wouldn't mind pitching in                     │ extratone
 malvarma | if you think of anything, you can send it to me at norm@neverheardof.me or hmu on mastodon                                                                                                │ fauly
 malvarma | I have some experience with technical writing, though I should confess, most of my experience is with marketing / copywriting        
extratone | malvarma that's perfect! I'm going to spin up a VCF file right now or I'll forget lol.
