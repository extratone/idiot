Howdy, Town!

I finally finished [my guide on participating in The Tildeverse from an iPhone using Blink Shell](https://bilge.world/tildetown-iphone-blink-shell). I hope it’s useful to somebody out there. If you can think of any way it could be *more* useful and/or have any questions for me, town mail is probably the best place to send them (extratone@tilde.town, I believe.) You can also view the guide [on town](https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink) if you’re the sort who’d rather never leave hehe.

Perhaps the most useful bit of the guide are the included commands required to configure WeeChat [as I have](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/weechat.png):

- `/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9`
- `/bar hide bufflist`
- `/bar hide fset`
- `/bar hide title`
- `/bar hide nicklist`
- `/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format "%M"`

I owe a big thanks to [m455](https://tilde.town/~m455) for pretty much singlehandedly saving my day as far as making chat usable in portrait mode on The Phone. Not that I particularly care about viewership, but Writeas’ backend says the guide has already garnered nearly 100 views, which is a pretty big deal for a few hours-new post on *The Psalms*.

Some other interesting, town-related links I’ve found from bbj/town chat:
- [elly](https://tilde.town/~elly)’s [guide on how to use ed](https://elly.town/d/blog/2015-10-03-ed-tutorial.txt)
- [dozens](https://tilde.town/~dozens)’ [Tilde Whirl podcast](https://tilde.town/~dozens/podcast)
- [vilmibm](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm)’s [Town History page](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/town.html)

I also discovered [ttm.sh](https://ttm.sh), Town’s image-sharing service. I plan to use it instead of taking up too much space by continuing to fill up [my own /images folder](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images).
