# Botany 
Live and step lightly,
young lovers
Live and step lightly,
old friend

The bounty deceives
and the sea is too deep

Seeds newly, unevenly, recently
deposited in the soil black

Walk with your old boots vâ€™d,
joined at the back
cover them

===

Searching for value in tiny towns
Touching everything,
Cheaply
.........but I breathe in every whisper of audacity
so that I can fill myself up
and become something
