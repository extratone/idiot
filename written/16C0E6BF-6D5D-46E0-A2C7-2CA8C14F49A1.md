In the Tot 1.0.3 for macOS release, a theme editor was added:

- Use Option key in Tot menu or Cmd-Option-, to open Theme Preferences
- Select the dot you want to change in the main window
- Changes to color well are displayed immediately
- New colors are synced to all devices, including iOS
- Share your theme as .tot file with save/load in Theme Preferences
- Theme file is JSON with hex colors: easy to modify in text editor, too
