it's been a wee bit!

I'm pretty sure this action I made for @draftsapp is *the* fastest means of retrieving fully-formatted Twitter embed code for content supported by the publish dot twitter dot com tool. https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2Ah

## Description

Open the selected Twitter URL in Twitter's publish (embed) tool within Drafts. If no text is selected, the entire draft contents will be passed.

## Directory Description

Open the selected Twitter URL in Twitter's [publish (embed) tool](https://publish.twitter.com) within Drafts using the following format:

`https://publish.twitter.com/?query=[selection]`

I created this action as the easiest means I could personally see to retrieve *fully-formatted* Twitter embed code as quickly as possible. Here's a [very brief video demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/174446424-a99d14fa-2f20-4fdd-84b9-d025aed5e162.MOV).
