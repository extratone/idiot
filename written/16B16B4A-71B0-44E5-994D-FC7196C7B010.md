# Response to Tim

> I would like to write (for you) again, Im burnt out on personal writing and need a goal, I was writing about 5 pages a day constantly for the last year. Mostly esoteric christian theology diatribes and personal relationship stuff.

well you know how much that means to me that you’d think of me first. and honestly that sounds like a refreshing conversation to have publicly with oneself in written form. it might actually be good for me to take a break from the (ultra-specific documentation project I’ve taken on) to even play editor but I can’t promise too much in that regard.

OH fuck!!! You know what just occurred to me? Extratone has a send-to-publish email address I’ve never used before that might prove just the right pipeline hehe.
