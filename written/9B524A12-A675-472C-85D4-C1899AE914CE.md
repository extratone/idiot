# The Raindrop Safari Extension Fix for macOS

Apologies if you guys have already mentioned and/or covered this, but I suspect it'll be pretty darn useful if you hadn't.

The Save to Raindrop extension (and a bunch of others, it turns out) randomly disappeared from macOS Safari a few days ago. It's apparently been happening enough that Rustem felt compelled to put up a dedicated help page about it: https://help.raindrop.io/safari-mac-problems/

Said document instructs one to execute the command below in terminal and then reboot, which resurfaced not only Raindrop but at least 4-5 other plugins I'd somehow completely forgotten about lol.
