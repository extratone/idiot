[Microsoft shuts down Cortana on iOS and Android - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361687/microsoft-cortana-shut-down-ios-android-mobile-app)

> What do you mean "didn’t succeed"? A five year run, before abandonment, is typical for most Microsoft products. Haven’t you looked at all the Microsoft electronic waste on that top shelf in your office? I chuckle at the thought that Microsoft thinks Cortana can be repositioned as "an assistant that can improve Microsoft’s enterprise-focused offerings". Heck, since Windows 7, in late 2009, every "enterprise" has had built-in voice dictation in their Windows operating system, and almost all of them didn’t know it existed and never used it. I wonder if the staff in Redmond realizes they could be dictating most of their documents?
