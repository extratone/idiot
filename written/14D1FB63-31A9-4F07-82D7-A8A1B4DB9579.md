so I was messing around in macOS shortcuts last night and stumbled upon something genuinely surprising. Automaticc seems to have snuck their `Post to Wordpress` action on macOS by way of [the Simplenote for macOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simplenote-notes-and-memos/id692867256)...

and it works! it worked the very first time I tried it - publishing a public post immediately and returning the URL.

[here’s an example shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4dcf5371a0854209b3763d0c3e64f3e3), in which you’ll note (if you look at it on iOS/iPad OS) the action just appears as the WordPress for iOS action lol.

and [here’s the post](https://neoyokel.wordpress.com/2022/05/16/colossus/) for pwoof.
