A few weeks ago, [Federico wrote about Command Browser](https://mailchi.mp/macstories/gfry3qyfriggry3figfyr3qgyfrqygfri3rq3gyuiaqwsticci) in the App Debuts section of Weekly. Command is an iPhone and iPad web browser that also works on M1 Macs. I’d never heard of Command, but when I read what Federico had to say about it, I was intrigued. If you’ve been following our recent exploration of research tools here and on [AppStories](https://appstories.net), you’ll understand why this app caught Federico’s eye, and I jumped on it too.

Command is billed as a journaling browser, but to my mind, it’s just as good for pure online research. As you browse the web, you can highlight passages on a page and save them to journals with a link back to the source and an optional note. If Command sounds like the Quick Note feature coming to iOS and iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey, that’s because there is definitely a resemblance between the two. However, there are also significant differences.
