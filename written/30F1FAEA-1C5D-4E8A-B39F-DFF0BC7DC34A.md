if you haven't already, brad, you might look into what it would take to integrate with embedly as a quick/temporary means of enabling embeds until you can build something bespoke (which I assume you'd prefer hehe.)

Writeas (the federated blogging platform I've been invested in since 2018) just added embedly support, which I came very close to dreading until I actually tried it. it's far more slick than it used to be.
