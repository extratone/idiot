G̏̽͋ͩͬ͊̈́o͌ͭ͆̂̍̈́̌oͩ͒ͩd̋̃͑ ͐ͣm̌orͬͥͤͣ̊n̋ͧͩ͐i͛̉n̔̎g̏͂̔ͦ̈ Tildeverse!

I’ve been working more with [Blink Shell](https://testflight.apple.com/v1/app/1156707581) and have discovered that it basically maintains a persistent local directory of my whole Tilde site in the Files app, which is exciting! This means I can easily upload [images](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images) and [videos](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos) from [my iPhone 12 Pro Max](https://github.com/extratone/jorts) using the process outlined in [this short video tutorial](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos/uploadingimageswithblink.MP4):

### Mini Tutorial: [Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos/uploadingimageswithblink.MP4)

I decided this discovery justifies [writing a full-ish guide](https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink) on using [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248) & [Blink Shell](https://testflight.apple.com/v1/app/1156707581) to interact with the Tildeverse on iOS.

I also added a few new directories/cleaned up some files:
- Added [/images](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images)
- Added [/videos](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos)
- Added [/manual](https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual) for... manuals
- I also added [a duplicate](https://tilde.town/~extratone/nano) of [the full online GNU-nano manual](https://nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) to my Tilde site for both our reference.

Hello ~ town!

I’ve finally got things figured out, I think. I’ve been interacting with you entirely from my iPhone 12 Pro Max (name: [Jorts](https://github.com/extratone/jorts).) I’m not sure if this blog supports markdown… Hope so! I like to tell people [it saved my life](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue).
oh yeah! I know it’s on [my main page](https://tilde.town/~extratone/), but here’s my contact info just in case:

Just saw that [nano 6.1 was released](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2022-02/msg00008.html) which surely must be some interesting news for some.

I release my [TrippleTap Reminder shortcut on RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11038/). Its documentation is as follows:

# TrippleTap Reminder Shortcut

- [iCloud Share Link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9e9ef38789ab418ca11371968a538611)
- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/extratone/i/issues/138)

## Create a reminder with URL and last image taken.

![TrippleTap Reminder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153335868-460caecf-a013-41e2-a448-862171dbb086.png)

This shortcut creates a reminder on a list set at install at a time in the future specified at install including a timestamp in [DavodTime](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/DavodTime), a URL captured from the clipboard, and the last image saved. I have it set to be triggered on the Triple tap [Back Tap](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211781) setting.

### Steps
1. An [Ask For Input](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/ask-for-input/) action prompts for the reminder title.
2. A duration of your choosing is added to the current time with an [Adjust Date](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/adjust-date/) action.
3. A [Get Latest Photos](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-latest-photos) action gets the latest photo saved.
4. A URL - if any - is grabbed from the clipboard.
5. A reminder is created using an [Add New Reminder](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/add-new-reminder) action with the details gathered above.

Hello, ~ town!
I'm very excited to be here, though please be warned... it may take me a bit to figure everything out.

An excerpt from my upcoming “[How to Fuck Text](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/222)” guide:

> …I believe my Text Fucking career began somewhere around the 7th grade, at 13-14 years old. It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially-growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files.

I was delighted by Drafts developer Greg when he shared [a Zalgotext Drafts Action](https://bilge.world/drafts-zalgo-action) in response to a request on Twitter earlier this afternoon.
