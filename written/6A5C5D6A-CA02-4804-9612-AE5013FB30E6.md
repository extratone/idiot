alright Mastodon, I have a cultural question for you...

I happen to be privileged to have known (and know) a great many people of a particular originality and talent - many of whom have managed to turn that talent (music production, motion graphics, and video editing are the core) into real professional lives.

one of the things we still come together on, as vain as it sounds, are anecdotes from their loosely-collective history. I have a few who once found their lives interwoven with ChrisChan's, for instance....

what I want to ask you is... does the Fediverse have anything to gain, really, in having these subjects occasionally yanked from the pre-2015 era internet? I have brought things up here under the (silly) assumption that my Mastodon followers have generally parallel knowledge of/experience with/investment in the same touchpoints and been met with confusion... and like, not the curious sort lol.

if that makes any sense, I'm just now wondering if some of that Old Fashioned Social Web Culture should maybe even be *actively omitted* from my own voice, here, given that a lot of it deals with some pretty traumatic shit - notably, *not* in a way I can imagine being constructive, anymore.

cuz ya know... you *could* just fuck off forever into your own thing, my federated friends.
