I was wondering if you'd be willing to chat about Whyp on voice some time. I'd like to record it for my podcast feed but that's not a requirement if you're not comfortable. I spoke briefly to one of my musician friends who used Clyp regularly, today, and realized that I need to write about Whyp sooner rather than later.
