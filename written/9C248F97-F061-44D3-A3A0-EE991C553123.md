Hello! You’ve made it to my Tilde Town directory! To be honest, it’s very far from the most interesting I’ve seen on here. I made a Raindrop collection of *all* TildeTown directories which you should definitely explore: https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136

I’m new here as of the beginning of 2022, but - as you might notice - I’ve already put up a bunch of shit on this site. Perhaps *too* much, which is why I intend to maintain a mirror, here: https://davidblue.wtf/tilde

Please feel free to reach out with bereavement/shitshooting/feedback/etc. Here’s a list of my contact info:
