In my new acceptance of the name *Extratone*'s true relationship with myself as an individual """"creator,"""" I have resumed uploading my own distinctly personal videos to [*Extratone*'s YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/extratone). Recently, this has taken the form of two 4K, phone-shot, unhygienic "one take" """"reviews"""" on two distinctly opposing products from the Toyota Motor Corporation: Sierra's filthy [2018 Prius c Two](https://youtu.be/8_13cx1ZmoA) and Eryn's melancholy [1999 Avalon](https://youtu.be/d5GLOg2F53c), and prompted a bit of reflective opining on this great institution of which I find my own understanding (perhaps presumptuously) quite comfortable.

One of my [first relatively well-researched columns](https://extratone.com/honda-hyundai-evolution-trend-industry-quality) for *[Speedmonkey](http://speedmonkey.co.uk)* addressed the 2012 position of Japanese automakers in the global industry as definite post-disruptors.
