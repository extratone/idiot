as a former auto journo & also longtime iJustine fan, I’d just like to express my full support & enthusiasm about automakers finally realizing they should have been treating y'all tech youtubers as real tech journos this whole time. I know there's some bitterness about it from legacy auto media (which I understand but lament,) but it's very important for all of us to take this opportunity to *discuss how we can work together* toward a better future for the whole industry spectrum. 

also, 

FLEX!! 👏 🙌 🔥🔥
