# To My Little Tractor
I heard that you'd found a new family recently
and I wondered 
how strange it would be for anyone
to do with you the things we did once
without knowing my name

I think about the condition
of your fame
as you approach your centennial 
and what people will say
and what they haven't

I remember the day we met
and an old white display
covered in ashes

I was military marching 
through a muddy field
full of tired old implements

Some had rusted beyond identification
Others were clinging to the better side
of the line between usefulness and nostalgia

It was so wet,
the ground didn't seem itself
It absorbed my cold rubber boots
They made sucking noises
in tune with their smacking against my calves

You sat with your ridiculous face
Your fading orange paint

That big black cylinder with the flush pulley
I couldn't stop staring at it

Some bolts were missing

Your wide bus steering wheel
that left black grit and an old
smell on my hands

I laughed at the placement of your 
pedals and the deckplating noise
they made when depressed

I looked right and left
and saw your cracked tires peeking
above those old gray fenders
like shoulders 
in perfect symmetry

The inside of your wheels
attached to orange drum brakes with a mechanical rod

I pushed and pulled your shifter 
through old gears 
(without synchromesh)
and watched the stale boot as it 
bent and split, its lips forming 
some personified embarrassing function

Even your cooling fan was orange, 
with the belt that drove it

Your throttle looked like an orange thermometer
When I pulled it down through the notches,
your fan sounded exactly like the great night fans on
the grain bins
(They could blow me over and hurt my ears)

I laughed,
bouncing on your seat,
enjoying the beauty in every angle

You were still a snotty little bully 
among larger equipment
seventy years later

Front tires so thin,
they appeared useless
I loved watching them so much,
I once lied to dad and 
said I didn't notice their sodding 
of the pasture grass as they tilted
and turned

You must've seemed ahead of your time
ten years after you were built
A cute accessory to the returning soldier's
ten acre paradise

The crowd moved about the field,
following a red-striped auctioneer 
like old donkeys
A mass of faded hats with bankrupt seed company logos,
denim shirts, cigarettes, and Dickies coats

I'm guessing they smoked 
and laughed at crude jokes
But honestly,
I never bothered to notice

Though it was a little embarrassing when
the mob surrounded us
and the auctioneer used 
the word cute
a few times 

Oddly enough, we did make a pair,
you and I
A seven-year-old kid
on a tractor ten times that

We weren't worth much to anyone,
together or apart

You'd seen as much as my grandpa
and you expected to sink down
in that mud with dignity,
holding eye contact with the old house
as it shed shingles,
both of you giggling at fate
Appear in some old farmer's field of vision
every once in a while 
In his thoughts,
even less

The picture we made humored 
the murder members who'd had enough coffee,
and I grew angry

The red-striped auctioneer yelled
for someone to start you

I used a whir of little hands
to convince your starter
wewopwewopwopwewopwop
I pulled out your choke
You spat black black smoke
that smelled of old lubricant remedies
with exclamations on the can
The whine of your orange fan
As your blades turned
to a solid translucent pancake

I carefully modulated your controls
before looking up with pride
But all we did was stop the smiling
I hadn't redeemed you much
I felt like crying

Somebody told me to stop your engine
and the bidding began

Nobody was thrilled,
the process reeked of obligation

I tried to figure out where your ears were
so I could cover them

But then dad raised his hand
and it didn't seem like much of a surprise
We'd already been matched,
you and I

All the others sensed it too,
and went about their business
of concealing wisdom

And so, we came to be together
Dad's attempts at getting you on a trailer
with a slipping clutch
bore the first time I laughed at him

I laughed again
when we drained your oil
It smelled as if it had soured
and looked like soupy cottage cheese

I laughed at
your darting travel method

Dad called you *squirrelly*

I'm sure whoever made you was 
very confused about what you should be
Not that it ever bothered me

We mowed a lot of grass
I did a lot of sneezing
The heads hit your grill and
I wondered if you were allergic like me
Maybe you wanted some antihistamines? 

We didn't always mow straight or fast,
but we'd get the job done

Our pace and reliability equally 
frustrating for dad

Remember
that evening we mowed the acre patch West
of your shed?
On top of the hill,
we could see the red sun
as it began to hide in the 
neighbors' beans
and you crawled through
yellow fescue heads,
humming in reliable intent

I know you were observing 
the moment like I was
Maybe you thought, 
too
of how we'd always be together

Twenty or thirty years from then
we would live the same scene
Except it would be somewhere a little colder
where I wouldn't sneeze
and the mower's discharge
would smell of tea
Dad wouldn't be there
to be frustrated with us

I'd have my own money for gas
to pour under your flying cap

I could drive you to school
if I wanted to and
show you to all my friends

We'd participate in those stupid parades,
milling around town,
throwing candy at children,
looking our best

I'm sorry to say now
I have no place to keep you where I'm living
I'd get ticketed if I took you to school
(I don't have any friends there anyway)
I have no grass to mow
and I'm not much fun anymore 

So, 
I guess I shouldn't regret
not coming to get you,
or my lack of time spent with you there

I know what we had is something
I'll be trying to get back
for a very long time

Be glad you've aged so slowly

I leave you dotingly 
with fondness and well wishes
I hope you dirty another conspirator's hands
and that they will become a friend
who will do with you
all the things little boys
and little tractors should do

Pain is a disease
Pick one tree,
plant straight beans
breathe
...steady
......squeeze
