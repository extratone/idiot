**I'm David Blue - an automotive journalist on sabbatical and self-described _Software Historian_.**

It's good to be here!

By that I mean, it's especially nice to feel welcome here even though **I am in no way a software developer**.

I use the term _Software Historian_ because I have found myself especially fascinated with the origin stories of the platforms and services we use in the past 3-4 years, especially regarding Word Processors.

My _ultimate_ software development aspiration would be to build my own CMS with Python from scratch, but I'm not just being humble when I tell you that I am _very_ far away from doing that.

Recently, I have been toying with the idea of writing a _Literary History of Streaming Music_, directly inspired by Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum's _[Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076)_, continuing the work I began in one of my all-time best essays **[examining the Holiness of Bandcamp](https://davidblue.wtf/essays/bandcamp)** as a technology company who can do no wrong.

I'm sure anyone reading this can relate when I lament that _I really should get around to writing an updated bio_, but I've already spent enough time on this one, I think. Let me just _quote myself_ from my blog's about page:

_I’ve already born witness to innovation bridging divisions between people throughout the greatest informational renaissance my species has ever seen... Originally, I wrote about our relationship with **cars** ([2019 Volkswagen Atlas Review](https://dieselgoth.com/2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review)) and now **technology** ([Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music)) from a perspective that feels tedious or abstract to some, but is generally entertaining, through-and-through. I’m proud of the work I’ve done so far, which has been wild, absurd, reflective, and hilarious — occasionally all in the same work as I develop my voice._

I'm not just horsing around when I say **feel free to <email me> about literally anything**.
