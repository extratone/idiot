Take it from someone who just watched every single Disney Channel Original Movie on [Disney+](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/707638/9358?sharedid=vulture%20&subId2=\[\]vu\[p\]ck9e9ay75005syjye4o0okb4k\[u\]1\[t\]w\[r\]google.com\[d\]D\[z\]m): You _think _you want to revisit a Disney Channel Original Movie from your youth. You don’t. To paraphrase Matthew Broderick in Kenneth Lonergan’s _Margaret, _which is about teens but very much _not _a Disney Channel Original Movie:
_Márgarét, áre you beaming_  
_Over Cheetah Girls now streaming?_  
_It ís the blight man was born for,_  
_It is Margaret you mourn for._
I warn you: You’re not nostalgic for Disney Channel Original Movies. You’re nostalgic for a time when you were young and thought DCOMs were good, a time when you watched _Wizards of Waverly Place _at the rate at which you now watch presidential addresses (which is to say daily, unfortunately). Some of them hold up wonderfully or are at least great examples of Y2K fashion. But most DCOMs walk like a movie and talk like a movie and yet feel like an uncanny species of sub-movie. They are paced strangely and slowly and follow kid logic or, rather, a TV executive’s _idea _of kid logic. I say this from a place of love; I host a [Disney Channel Original Movies podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/disney-channel-original-groupies/id1248587636). Like, for fun. But if theatrical releases are Oreos, DCOMs are Hydrox. They’re their own thing.
Of course, there are exceptions. The works of Disney’s greatest living auteur, Kenny Ortega, for one. The works of Raven Symone, for another. Generally, if a DCOM is about learning to express yourself creatively, it plays better than the dead-parent ones, or the sports ones, or the ones about a protagonist learning to respect the differences between them and their bully/crush/townies. The fantasy ones are hit or miss; the science-fiction ones usually slap.
But good or bad, nearly [all of them are available to stream on Disney+](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/707638/9358?sharedid=vulture%20&subId2=\[\]vu\[p\]ck9e9ay75005syjye4o0okb4k\[u\]1\[t\]w\[r\]google.com\[d\]D\[z\]m), making them easier than ever for you to revisit. So we’ve gone ahead and ranked all of them to help guide you through the catalog. Maybe you’re watching these out of nostalgia or boredom; maybe you have kids at home and are looking for all-ages content to play during quarantine. They need to learn their history. They need to learn about _Smart House. _
**105\. _Radio Rebel _(2012)**  
A DCOM so bad, Disney has more or less disowned it. The real reason why _Radio Rebel_ isn’t available on Disney+ probably has less to do with shame and more based on distribution rights, due to it being a co-production with Canadian kids network YTV. Based on the original trailer, _[Radio Rebel _was produced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc91iQ1Ivjo) by third-party producer MarVista Entertainment and distributed by the DCOM machine after the fact. That would explain the decidedly _un_heimlich vibes of this Debby Ryan disasterpiece, about an awkward girl who’s secretly the most popular underground radio DJ in all of Seattle. The performances by Ryan and the background actors alike have become something of a TikTok meme recently, singled out and mimicked in [cringe compilations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9LaIBJe-s). If the Gen-Z culturati has decreed that _Radio Rebel _should be singled out and ridiculed, who am I to argue? _Radio Rebel _should consider itself lucky. In 2010, Disney aired another [MarVista Debby Ryan original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1kPQFXlqzE) in conjunction with a _different_ Canadian kids network, and didn’t even grant it entry into the DCOM pantheon at all. That’s right: _16 Wishes _is _not _DCOM canon.
**104\. _Freaky Friday _(2018)**
This did not have to be done. Why was this done? It very much did not have to be. There is nothing wrong with remaking a classic for a new generation. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis proved that when she remade the 1970s Jodie Foster _Freaky Friday _for the 2000s. This 2018 version makes some grave mistakes, though. It is a musical with terrible, lazy music, the kind that people who _think _they hate musical theater think all musical theater is. For another, the leads are deeply unpleasant, though not for lack of _so much effort_. Cozi Zuehlsdorff is a semi-unpleasant lead. Where Lindsay Lohan was punky and rebellious in _Freaky Friday_, Cozi’s Ellie is just sorta unhygienic and inconsiderate? The dreadful biology-class number, “[Oh, Biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ4BnBAWvVw),” is probably the moment when this movie tipped over from cringeworthy and mediocre to genuinely offensive: The “over-40 soul” in a teenage body sings about getting horny for a young boy, with lyrics like “Why can’t my grown-up brain control my teenage parts?” and “I’m not in control and hunger has its say and hormones have their way” and “Though we’re both 15, he’s much too young.” Lock this movie in the Disney Vault and then set the vault on fire.
**103\. _Geek Charming _(2011)**  
Watching every single Disney Channel Original Movie, I started to notice a dispiriting trend. As the decades rolled on, the movies started to get way _worse _when it came to gender. In the ’90s movies about ragtag groups of siblings or bowling enthusiasts, boys and girls were friends without too much comment, and female characters were allowed to be tomboyish, nerdy, or girlie without morality judgments one way or the other. Then we hit the height of aughts fabulousness, the indulgent, beautiful, unapologetic over-the-top butterfly-clip goodness of Lindsay and Hillary and Raven. _Geek Charming _features DCOM gender politics at their worst, though: All girls are inherently catty, shallow, and cruel, and boys are dopes of substance. Sarah Hyland plays popular girl Dylan, who is a grating affectation machine. She pronounces one-syllable words like two (“g_a-ROSSE”_), peppers her speech with a whole lot of “beaucoup” and “magnifique” and “d’accord,” and spells things out before she says ’em (“O-V-E-R, _over”_).
Her terrible secret is that she’s good at math, even though she’s a _girl. _She ends up befriending and giving a makeover to a mini–Mark Cohen high school documentarian and film geek who wants to shoot a doc “about the revolution of robot voices in the science-fiction genre,” but ends up making a home movie about how even _girls _can be _deep _when they’re not busy being so _shallow. _The main character is rude to her maid, the female best-friend characters are all props, and there are “jokes” (in 2011!) about how sushi is yucky raw fish. _Heathers _has better teen role models, and it’s about murder.
**102\. _You Lucky Dog _(1998)**  
Kirk Cameron stars in this caper about a fraud dog psychic whose body gets possessed sometimes by a dog who is also an heir to a fortune. There has never been a kids’ movie with so few actual kids; it’s all grown-ups acting snooty and an adult Kirk Cameron acting like a dog.
**101\. _Dadnapped _(2009)**  
In 2009, Disney was trying pretty hard to break Emily Osment out from under Miley Cyrus’s shadow. Disney was really trying to make the _Hannah Montana _sidekick and sibling to Haley Joel _happen, _you know? So they gave her this DCOM, which takes the plot of _Misery, _makes it kid-friendly, and gives the kidnapped novelist a scrappy daughter. It’s as unpleasant as that sounds.
**100\. _Bad Hair Day _(2015)**  
The plot of this movie is that on the day of the prom, prom-queen hopeful Laura Marano gets swept into a rote buddy-cop comedy with an adult PI played by Leigh-Allyn Baker, all while taking her driving test and having a very bad hair day. There’s something that feels very aimless and lost in translation about _Bad Hair Day, _like it was a neutered Melissa McCarthy project that went through rounds of rewrites before becoming a DCOM. The characters never totally mesh in this unfunny _Ride Along. _Above all, though, main problem here is the filmmakers were so effective at making Marano’s hair day _so _bad, it upsets me to look at. It’s very, very greasy and the word “crispy” gets thrown around and I couldn’t finish this movie because I didn’t want to look at it.
**99\. _The Poof Point _(2001)**  
Tahj Mowry’s parents Benjamin Button themselves, and the whole thing is impossibly cringe.
**98\. _Under Wraps _(1997)**
_Under Wraps _earns points for being the first-ever Disney Channel Original Movie, and loses points for being less of an in-mouse production. The movie was produced by Hallmark Entertainment and it the rights are now held by Universal, which would explain why it’s not available on Disney+. This movie about kids who discover a mummy and reunite it with its lost-mummy-love is a decent first effort, but it pales in comparison to Disney Channel’s later kiddie-macabre fare. Mummies just aren’t vampire or mermaid-tier monsters.
**97\. _Hatching Pete _(2009)**  
The tagline is “Cock-a-doodle-WHO??” and it’s the best thing about this movie. Disney Channel helmet-haired fixtures Jason Dolley and Mitchel Musso play friends who switch places as their school’s chicken mascot because Musso is allergic to the feathers. Typical misunderstandings ensue. There’s a lot of “bare-minimum comedy” at work here, as though the writers assumed chicken suits and fake sneezing were good enough for discerning Disney Channel audiences. Fun fact: Mitchel Musso and Tiffany Thornton released a single for this movie called “Let It Go,” so up until 2013, if someone mentioned “that Disney song ‘Let It Go,’” they were talking about a track by the kid who played Oliver on _Hannah Montana. _Know your history.
**96\. _The Other Me _(2000)**  
Andrew Lawrence clones himself and I’m thoroughly bored.
**95\. _Can of Worms _(1999)**  
Here’s what I liked about _Can of Worms: _Puppets. Practical effects. A talking dog with a C-3P0 accent. Here’s what I didn’t care for: _Can of Worms. _As you’ll see, there are movies on this list that do Space Teen better as a genre.
**94\. _Alley Cats Strike _(2000)**  
Disney Channel has made movies about every possible sport. Some sports warrant multiple movies, like how every other DCOM is about basketball. Even so: Who was the audience for this movie about a bunch of teens who listen to doo-wop music and are into _bowling _to a humorless degree in the year 2000? Tell me who!
**93\. _The Ultimate Christmas Present _(2000)**  
Tiny Brenda Song stars in this forgettable Christmas movie about two friends who steal Santa’s weather machine to make it snow in L.A. The premise is cute-enough kid stuff, but the grown elf-men in lederhosen are thoroughly disturbing, if never as funny as they’re intended to be. Lots of Disney Channel Original Movies feature food fights or people falling into goop. The goop can range from frozen yogurt to mud, Jell-O to alien slime. Here, it’s a vat of chocolate in a chocolate factory. I assume this is a reference to the Joker’s origin story? Hard to say.
**92\. _Good Luck Charlie, It’s Christmas _(2011)**  
I had phased out of Disney Channel by the time the sitcom _Good Luck Charlie _came around, but it’s about a family with a baby named Charlie. Most Disney sitcoms are about teens with powers and/or double lives. This is far too thin a premise. Not enough dogs, not enough blogs. _Good Luck Charlie _is the first DCOM adaptation of a Disney Channel series on this list, because it is the worst, because it is based on the worst, most boring show.
**91\. _Return to Halloweentown _(2006)**  
The Sinister Sisters walked so the Weird Sisters could run, sure, but replacing Kimberly J. Brown with Sara Paxton was so rude I don’t even want to finish this sentence.
**90\. _Jumping Ship _(2001)**
This sequel to the much better Lawrence-brothers vehicle _Horse Sense _takes them away from the horsies, which is already a point against it. Watching this made me wonder: How many DCOMs take place on a tropical island? Thirty?
**89\. _Invisible Sister _(2015)**  
Rowan Blanchard turns her popular older sister invisible. Then they have to switch places? It’s too similar a premise to Katherine Heigl’s _Wish Upon a Star, _which you’ll read more about shortly.
**88\. _Double Teamed _(2002)**  
This children’s movie is called _Double Teamed, _which is _insane. _Unfortunately, it doesn’t live up to the name. It’s about hypercompetitive twin sisters who are supposed to be 14 at most but who I believe are played by non-twin non-sister actors who are maybe 29 and who I believe were cast not for any acting ability but for being tall. They are bullied at school because they are tall, but they are also 29-year-old women who look nothing alike, surrounded by kids. It’s like that girl who plays Elle Woods in the most important YouTube video of all time, “[Legally Blonde: ‘Omigod You Guys’ feat. All-Star Cast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v8LF-YWKfo)” It is also about basketball.
**87\. _Phantom of the Megaplex _(2000)**  
This one’s a classic, but it’s so, so strange. A kid who doesn’t even appear to like movies all that much loves his job as the general manager of a movie theater. His passion is not for movies but for managerial skills, spreadsheets, and ordering people around. One fateful night, when important movie execs are there, a “Phantom of the Megaplex” sows chaos. The phantom turns out to be Mickey Rooney, and it’s kind of sad to watch, honestly?
**86\. _Kim Possible _(2019)**  
Like lesser animated classics _Beauty and the Beast _and _The Lion King, _the thing about the _Kim Possible _series_ _is that it’s a perfect art object as is, and is in no way served by a live-action adaptation. Sure, this DCOM has Patton Oswalt and Alyson Hannigan, who are both about as A-list as most DCOM grown-ups get, but there’s not nearly enough Christy Carlson Romano to make it worthwhile.
**85\. _Frenemies _(2012)**  
This movie stars Zendaya and Bella Thorne; therefore, it should be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the movie is broken up into three intertwining stories, and only the second one concerns this collab of a lifetime. It’s a pass.
**84\. _Motocrossed _(2001)**  
When a red-state DCOM doesn’t even have pretty horsies? Honey, what is the _point. _
**83\. _Twitches Too _(2007)**  
The sequel to Tia and Tamera Mowry classic _Twitches _is so very overladen with such a tiresome plot: In the magical land of Coventry, there is a shadow from the shadow realm attacking other shadows. But also, their wizard-dad (not their adopted Muggle-Dad) is dead but also trapped in shadow-land. When the dark lord Thantos is released, the Twitches put a stop to him by making him fall down a well. Spoiler alert, but there’s a happy ending where the annoying servant-sidekicks get married and don’t kiss. Despite watching it, I can barely tell you what actually happens. The Wikipedia page says that _Twitches Too _had a $26.5 million budget. Not a dollar went to the special effects.
**82\. _Buffalo Dreams _(2005)**  
Look, it is cool and majestic to see buffalo (the animal, not the city) on film. This is undeniably true. But everything you need to know about what makes _Buffalo Dreams _a little sus for 2005 is in this line of its plot summary: “In recognition of his bravery, Josh is made an honorary member of the Navajo tribe with the name Rides With the Wind.” Oof.
**81._ Genius _(1999)**
A small nerdy child loves hockey and physics, which are two things I have never been able to bring myself to care about. When he takes a TA job lecturing at a college because he’s Doogie Howser–style smart, he decides to reinvent himself at the local high school as “cool kid” Chaz. But a tiny Emmy Rossum is the love interest, and she figure-skates, and that’s fun.
**80\. _Quints _(2000)**  
A very early DCOM that asks, “What if there were five babies?” Kimberly J. Brown of _Halloweentown _fame narrates the whole thing in a _Clarissa Explains It All–_style fourth-wall break. I never thought I’d say this, but: Five babies is too darn many.
**79\. _The Suite Life Movie _(2011)**  
Dylan Sprouse plays slacker Zack and Cole Sprouse plays nerdy Cody in this movie adaptation of the _Suite Life _franchise. Where this one loses the mark for me is that it’s a sci-fi caper about a plan to mind-control sets of twins. But there is a subplot about all-time baddie and icon London Tipton (Brenda Song) talking to dolphins, which is very good, because it’s much more in the kooky spirit of the series.
**78\. _Wish Upon a Star _(1996)**  
Katherine Heigl is the cool big sister, and Danielle Harris is the dorky little sister. That is, until they trade places. Now we’re stuck watching Katherine Heigl play a dork. I was going to put this movie lower, but [Hunter Harris](https://www.vulture.com/author/hunter-harris/) said, “How was I supposed to learn what a hickey was without that movie,” which is as good a justification for it as any! In fact, it’s what a DCOM _should _do, we say.
**77\. _Zapped _(2014)**  
Zendaya’s phone can control boys! This movie falls into a bit of the “girls are like _this _and boys are like _this” _trap, but it’s so much better than it would have been if it didn’t star Zendaya.
**76\. _Princess Protection Program _(2009)**  
Demi Lovato is a princess of an off-brand [Genovia](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=genovia/detail=factbook/id=1011441) who must go into hiding with regular American tomboy Selena Gomez** **in her Louisiana swamp home. Along the way, there’s a super-secret spy agency that gives princesses makeovers, a devious scheming designer named Mr. Elegante, and more of those annoying, terrible gender politics about how a girl’s worst enemy is other girls, unless they’re a down-to-earth girl, who you can always tell apart from the other (evil shallow) girls by their flannel shirts. Also, the basic premise of _PPP _is fundamentally hilarious to me because it’s about how a wealthy princess in the 21st century is clueless, sheltered, and innocent, when in reality she’d be partying in Ibiza.** **The fantastic thing about this movie is that [Cousin Greg](https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/nicholas-braun-succession-cousin-greg-encounter.html) is in it.
**75\. _’Twas the Night _(2001)**  
Bryan Cranston plays a criminal who out of desperation drags his family into his seedy misdeeds. Only it’s not _Breaking Bad_;_ _it’s a Christmas DCOM from 2001 where he has to be Santa for a night. This is one of those DCOMs like _You Lucky Dog _or _Bad Hair Day_ that has way too much grown-up business.
**74\. _Johnny Kapahala: Back on Board _(2007)**  
﻿The original Johnny Tsunami was predicated on a brilliantly simple premise: What if a tropical surfer dude became a snowboarder? It works. Also, Brandon Baker was adorable as the plucky lead. The sequel was filmed an inexplicable eight years later, and finds Johnny … mudboarding? I’m good, luv.
**73\. _Phineas and Ferb: The Movie _(2011)**
DCOM adaptations of live-action Disney Channel series usually feel like distinct works, because they switch from the sitcom multicam to a more cinematic single cam. In contrast, the _Phineas and Ferb _movie feels like a supersized episode of _Phineas and Ferb_. Which is good news for _Phineas and Ferb _fans, which I’m sure many of you are! I personally think it’s a sub–_Dave the Barbarian–_tier Disney cartoon that hit huge because it came out in an era when “random” automatically meant “funny,” but didn’t have the artistry of its far wackier Cartoon Network contemporaries or the sincerity of earlier Disney Channel cartoons and … Oy. Never mind. It’s about the boys discovering the truth about Perry the Platypus. Fine.
**72\. _Gotta Kick It Up! _(2002)**  
This one had so much potential. “Susan Egan coaches America Ferrera in a Latina spin on _Bring It On_” sounds like DCOM gold, but where _Bring It On _had jokes, this has blandly inspiring Disney Channel halfwayism. What a shame.
**71\. _You Wish! _(2003)**  
The sidekick from _Even Stevens _and the sidekick from _Lizzie McGuire _join forces in a sidekick jamboree about a boy who wishes his little brother, Spencer Breslin, went away. It ends up being a meditation on the terrible realities of child stardom, which is especially fucked up considering, you know, Disney Channel.
**70\. _Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie _(2009)**  
Selena Gomez and her wizard family go on vacation to the Caribbean, and it’s pretty watchable and funny enough.
**69\. _Zenon: The Zequel _(2001)**  
NOBODY** **replaces Raven.
**68\. _How to Build a Better Boy _(2014)**  
Mae and Gabby are unpopular nerds at their high school, which is confusing because whoever did the costume design for this went _off _and made them look pretty cool. Mae has a crush on Noah Centineo, but mean girl Nevaeh wants him for herself, so Mae and Gabby basically build a _Westworld _host to take Mae to the dance instead. The Pentagon gets involved. This movie is probably a shade too kooky for its own good, but how can I be mad at a DCOM about teens who build a bioweapon prom date and face off with a shadowy arms dealer? Also, Centineo’s name is “Jaden Stark.”
**67\. _Zombies _(2018)**  
Zombies live on the rough side of town. Humans go to a preppy school where they follow the rules and fear the zombies. What happens when the zombies go to human school? Love and musical numbers!
**66\. _Descendants _(2015)**  
Disney villains live on the bad side of town. Good guys go to a preppy school where they follow the rules and fear the villains. What happens when the villains go to good-guy school? Love and musical numbers! This is kind of a fever dream, but it edges out _Zombies _because Kristin Chenoweth plays Maleficent and Kathy Najimy plays the Evil Queen, and those casting decisions are huge for me, personally.** **Like _Zombies _the DCOM_, Descendants _was an absolute phenomenon when it came out. But unlike the deteriorating-flesh monsters, this franchise only gets better with time.
**65\. _Girl vs. Monster _(2012)**  
Olivia Holt is a fifth-generation monster hunter in this spooky Halloween DCOM.** **Disney Channel has its fair share of supernatural Halloween movies, and this one isn’t the strongest, but what really matters in _Girl vs. Monster _are [the bops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IW1yAPF3lo)! “Monster Mash” who?
**64\. _Starstruck _(2010)**  
A celebrity superstar falls in love with just a regular girl. The celebrity superstar is played by Sterling Knight, who looks like a wax figure. His sidekick is played by Brandon Mychal Smith, a.k.a. Sam from _You’re the Worst, _who elevates every Disney Channel product he touches. This movie is very “just fine.” It will roll right off your quarantine-smoothed brain like water off a duck’s back.
**63\. _Miracle in Lane 2 _(2000)**  
Frankie Muniz stars in the true story of a boy with spina bifida who finds a passion for soapbox-derby racing. This film mostly stuck with me from childhood because there’s a scene where God(?) shows him a glimpse of heaven(???) and it’s full of dead children in wheelchairs with wings, flying around(??!?!??!??!?!). I understand the message it is trying to impart, but that doesn’t make it not scary.
**62\. _Cloud 9 _(2014)**  
This Dove Cameron movie about competitive snowboarders falling in love at a lodge feels like some sort of missing link between DCOMs and more mature, mellow Hallmark romance movies. And that’s a good thing! Still, there are better snowboarding movies on this list.
**61\. _Go Figure _(2005)**
A figure skater gets a hockey scholarship so that she can train with a renowned Russian skating coach who is very mean, so you know she’s good. Kristi Yamaguchi cameos as herself. There’s a Brie Larson song on the soundtrack. Why is hockey such a mainstay in so many DCOMs? Is it because the majority of them film in Vancouver and Toronto neighborhoods that ably pose as American suburbs, and so the child actors and extras are all preternaturally talented at hockey? Maybe so.
**60\. _Minutemen _(2008)**  
This DCOM about time-traveling teens gave us “Like whoa” from Aly & AJ. It also gave us Nicholas Braun in a leather jacket on a motorcycle. His character’s name is “Zeke,” as this DCOM was released in the era when there had to be at least one character per film named “Zeke.”** **Time travel is always a minefield, but _Minutemen _has a fun, solid take on it that holds up.
**59\. _Now You See It … _(2005)**  
_Now You See It _is a hat on a hat on a hat. It is about a teen magician competition. But it’s also a teen magician competition reality series. But it’s also a teen magician competition reality series where the producers, camerapeople, and boom operators are also teens. And it’s also a semi-mockumentary about the “making of” the teen magician competition reality series, by one of the teen producers, Aly Michalka. I take it back. It’s not too many hats. _More_ hats, please!
**58\. _Hounded _(2001)**  
_Smart Guy’_s Tahj Mowry is bullied at prep school by Shia LaBeouf, whose dad is the headmaster and also Ed Begley Jr. This should be reason enough to watch, but if you still need convincing, most of the action centers around a Chihuahua named Camille.
**57\. _Don’t Look Under the Bed _(1999)**  
_Don’t Look Under the Bed _was so scary, apparently, that it got a rare PG rating and eventually stopped being played on Disney Channel altogether. The concept of there being a whole world under the bed where the bogeyman lives is a good one; it’s a shame that they saved it for the last 20 minutes of the movie. Also: “Larry Houdini.”
**56\. _Den Brother _(2010)**  
A hockey-loving teen (because what else?) becomes a Girl Scout troop leader in order to win the affections of the popular girl. The rival scout-leader mom is a perfectly played-to-11 villain in an otherwise sweet, low-key movie.
**55\. _Read it and Weep _(2006)**  
The premise is kind of like _Diary of a Wimpy Kid _meets _A Million Little Pieces _meets Carrie Bradshaw’s book launch. Make sense?** **No? Hm. Okay: Jamie is an awkward teen who writes doodle-filled wish-fulfillment diaries about a fictionalized version of herself, and the diary becomes a best seller. Here’s the real mind trip, though: Jamie and her fantasy alter ego Isabella are played by sisters Kay and Danielle Panabaker, who have each appeared in multiple DCOMs and who I thought were the same person until literally now.
**54\. _Ready to Run _(2000)**  
Like the David Milch series _Luck, _only without all the horse death … that we know of. Jason Dohring plays a rodeo clown in a shirt that I would very much like to own in this story of a girl who wants to be a jockey in a sport dominated by small men. She soothes a skittish horse using noise-canceling headphones. I’m sure this movie will go over big in a household of horse girls, but I expected revolutionary things from a movie named after an S-tier Dixie Chicks song.
**53\. _Tiger Cruise _(2004)**  
Hayden Panettiere is a Navy brat who’s on a “Tiger Cruise” for military kids on an aircraft carrier on September 11, 2001. It’s the most Bush-era rah-rah DCOM there is, but it was filmed on actual U.S. Navy supercarriers and therefore a cool watch for kids who are into ships ’n’ planes ’n’ things.
**52\. _Rip Girls _(2000)**  
A sweet, earnest DCOM about a tween who moves back to the Hawaiian island where she was born and learns about herself, her heritage, and surfing. There’s an evil-colonizer–resort-developer subplot.
**51\. _Up Up and Away _(2000)**  
_Up Up and Away _was the original _[Sky High_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_High_\(2005_film\))_, _and nobody can tell me otherwise. An average, powerless tween deals with his family of superheroes whose only weakness is tinfoil.
**50\. _Stepsister From the Planet Weird _(2000)**  
This movie ranks as high as it does for having _the _wildest sci-fi graphics I have ever seen in any movie, Disney Channel Original or otherwise, before or since. It only happens for a brief sequence, but when we see the alien sister’s home planet and she tells her family’s story, it’s so Y2K chic it defies explanation.
**49\. _Life Is Ruff _(2005)**  
_Best in Show _meets _Cory in the House. _A combo you didn’t know you needed, until now.
**48\. _Halloweentown High _(2004)**
Before zombies went to human high school or villains went to good-guy high school, the _Halloweentown _franchise arranged an exchange program for some monster kids, including some _High School Musical _backbenchers like Lucas Grabeel and Olesya Rulin. Finn Wittrock plays the love interest! I loved this movie as a kid, but upon rewatch, it makes less than no sense and the plot is writing special-effects checks that its budget can’t catch. This is the last _Halloweentown _movie with the dream team of Debbie Reynolds and Kimberly J. Brown, though, so it’s a significant milestone in DCOM history.
**47\. _Horse Sense _(1999)**  
Joey and Andrew Lawrence pet pretty horsies and build the perfect treehouse in this very good-enough DCOM. The “spoiled kid learning humility and good ol’ American values through farm work” thing is similar to _Cow Belles, _but this is a much mellower breed of movie.
**46\. _Descendants 2 _(2017)**  
The sequel to _Descendants _replaces Kristen Chenoweth with an actual lizard(?) and it didn’t have those big Najimy bucks either, but it’s an all-around better movie, centering around a bunch _more _villain kids who try to ruin Dove Cameron and the Son of the Beast’s happily ever after. Namely, Ursula’s daughter Uma puts a love spell on the Son of the Beast, and eventually turns into a massive sea witch, recreating the climax of _The Little Mermaid. _The sons of Captain Hook and Gaston are her guylinered, ripped lackeys, and Lady Tremaine’s granddaughter runs an eeeeeevil hair salon and is played by Anna Cathcart, Kitty from _To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before. _If all this sounds like a fevered _Once Upon a Time _spec script, that’s because it very well may be one.
**45\. _Avalon High _(2010)**  
I love Arthurian nonsense, and so I’m all for this Meg Cabot adaptation about a daughter of medieval-studies professors whose high school is tied to the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.
**44\. _Teen Beach 2 _(2015)**  
This sequel couldn’t have possibly lived up to the impossibly high expectations I had for it. Anyone who has ever been cornered by me at a party knows that I think _Teen Beach Movie _is a masterpiece of postmodern cinema. The sequel, which does the obvious thing of “You’ve seen these modern kids in ’60s movie world, now let’s see the ’60s movie kids in the modern world” that was teased in the original _Teen Beach _post-credits. But any of the sly gender subversion at play in the first movie gets done to death far too bluntly in the sequel. And “These movie characters don’t know what a phone is!” jokes don’t make me laugh quite as hard as “these Gen-Zers don’t know who Gidget is!” jokes, because the former are done to death and the latter are patently insane. I admire how _Teen Beach 2 _commits to its high-stakes ending for the leads. Ultimately, though, the songs just aren’t as good, and that’s kind of the whole appeal of the first one.
**43\. _Mom’s Got a Date With a Vampire _(2000)**  
Caroline Rhea plays the _titular _mom, and Mr. Sheffield from _The Nanny _is the _titular _vampire. The kids elicit a big shrug, but the adults are fun.
**42\. _The Thirteenth Year _(1999)**  
A young merbaby is abandoned by his mermom at birth and grows up in the human world, unaware of his origins, and a fan of competitive swimming. The decision to make this puberty parable about a merman instead of a dime-a-dozen mermaid is what tips _The Thirteenth Year _over into iconic. The 1999 special effects on his mertail and his glamorous telepathic mermom are icing on the mercake.
**41\. _Going to the Mat _(2004)**  
Andrew Lawrence is back, and this time he plays a blind teen with a passion for drumming who gets very into competitive wrestling. Watching this as a kid, I had never seen a blind character in this sort of active, protagonist role, and it definitely stuck with me. Kudos for that.
**40\. _Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama _(2005)**  
Now _this _is how you do a feature-length _Kim_ _Possible_ DCOM.
**39\. _The Even Stevens Movie _(2003)**
_Tim(!) Goddamn(!!) Meadows(!!!) _plays a scheming reality-TV producer who tricks the Stevens into going on a tropical vacation that’s _actually _the set of a reality show that they’re totally unaware they’re participating in. But it turns out Tim Meadows was being pranked all along by a _different _reality show. _Even Stevens _was so good, you guys.
**38\. _Tru Confessions _(2002)**  
Shia LaBeouf has his Leo–in–_What’s Eating Gilbert Grape _breakout moment as a teen with developmental disabilities. Instead of Johnny Depp, though, his sibling is a girl who escapes into a sitcom fantasy life, Abed Nadir style. It’s not a perfect DCOM by a long shot, but kudos for ambition.
**37\. _Cheetah Girls: One World _(2008)**  
We’ll say this for _Cheetah Girls: One World — _there isn’t another DCOM like it. The threequel finds the pop group traveling to India to compete against each other for the lead role in a Bollywood film called “Namaste, Bombay.” Raven Symone left the project, though, and her absence is certainly felt.
**36\. _Right on Track _(2003)**  
Did you know there was a period of time that doesn’t get talked about in American-history class, when if you put Beverly Mitchell and Brie Larson side-by-side in a movie, Mitchell was the more famous of the two? In 2003, they starred in a movie about the kind of drag race I don’t normally go for. But hey, the cars vroom-vroom real fast, and as with _Ford v. Ferrari, _that counts for something.
**35\. _Cow Belles _(2006)**  
Mid-aughts power sibs Aly and A.J. Michalka play dairy heiresses who have to learn about responsibility by doing farm work. This fun, frivolous response to _The Simple Life _has an Aly & A.J. soundtrack that _do _slappeth, a cow-birth, and a hunky farmhand.
**34\. _Adventures in Babysitting _(2016)**  
This 2016 remake of the 1987 sleepover classic is the 100th DCOM ever made, and therefore some sort of milestone for terrible freaks (me). It’s … totally fine! Sabrina Carpenter always makes Disney Channel shows and movies more watchable than they have any right to be, and the scope of it feels slightly larger than similar DCOMs. There’s a laughably bad rap-battle scene that bumps this up a few spots.
**33\. _Twitches _(2005)**  
_Twitches _really plugs into the teen fantasies of finding a long-lost identical twin sister and learning that you’ve got a magical destiny in another land. What doesn’t make total sense is that the twin witches in question are 21 and not, you know, _tweens. _So much of this movie stops making sense when you realize that Tia and Tamera Mowry were _almost 30 _when they made this. (And they _were _30 when the sequel came out.)** **The characters act like teens, and the plot feels so much more like teenage wish fulfillment. Why wasn’t _Twitches _made in the ’90s, when Tia and Tamera were at the height of their _Sister, Sister _powers and _Sabrina the Teenage Witch _made witches a whole thing? Oh, well. As a Harry Potter–obsessed tween, I remember liking _Twitches _a whole lot. And that’s who it’s for, after all, even if it’s about adults.
**32\. _Eddie’s Million Dollar Cook-Off _(2003)**  
A classic, this was a classic. Fourteen-year-old Eddie has to balance his love of baseball with his passion for cooking. He’s the star player on a ragtag Little League team that has a _college scout _coming to visit it. The team needs Eddie, but he wants to compete in the _titular Million Dollar Cook-Off, _which angers his father, who’s constantly spewing little microaggressions. There’s definitely a queer reading that _could _be made of _Million Dollar Cook-Off: _Eddie’s confused about his identity and what cooking means at a pivotal age; his father shuns him and is furious with him for doing something feminine while his mother understands. He’s ostracized at school for “cooking,” and he has a crush on Bobby Flay, who makes a cameo as himself. There’s lots of talk of how when dads and coaches say things like “You throw like a girl,” it’s perpetuates really hateful stuff: The kids have an “I am Spartacus” moment about this. It’s basically _Free to Be You and Me, 2003. _Still, by the second or third food-fight scene, I was over it. Watch this while you’re teaching your kids to cook on Week 200 of quarantine.
**31\. _Zenon Z3 _(2004)**  
Where _Cheetah Girls: One World _casts Raven aside, the Zenon threequel cleverly brings her back. Now, Zenon is competing to win the title of Galactic Teen Supreme, until she has to save Earth from a _moon goddess! _Incredible.
**30\. _Let it Shine _(2012)**
Tyler James Williams from _Everybody Hates Chris _plays the son of a pastor who calls rap “the devil’s music” (in the year 2012, can you imagine). He ends up writing and performing on behalf of his untalented friend, who plays the music off as his own to get with Roxie Andrews, a character named after [the greatest rapper of all time](https://youtu.be/PPTyqzM253Q?t=180). If you couldn’t tell yet, the premise is supposed to be a hip-hop teen version of _Cyrano de Bergerac. _The main character is even named Cyrus DeBarge. Brandon Mychal Smith steals scenes yet again as a rival rapper.
**29\. _Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure _(2011)**  
Can a movie not premiere on Disney Channel and still be a Disney Channel Original Movie? _Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure _can. This spinoff of the _High School Musical _franchise is the first Disney Channel Original Movie to be released straight to home video. Watching the movie, I would wager that Disney shunted it to the Walmart DVD bin because it taints the relative prestige of the _HSM _trilogy. In the spinoff, Ashley Tisdale’s spoiled theater girl Sharpay Evans moves to New York to try her shot at Broadway, shot on location in beautiful downtown Toronto. When her dog named Boi (insane) auditions for a dog musical (in-_sane_), he falls in love with a rival dog named Countess. Long, lingering dog-glances ensue while Ashley Tisdale stomps around saying things like “Daddy, the reason why I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps,” and “Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.” Austin Butler plays an NYU student who follows her around with a camera, because that’s Disney Channel’s No. 1 favorite romantic trope. For better or worse, this is the sort of high camp DCOM that I like. I watch movies like this and say “This is good” out loud. Sorry.** **
**28\. _Luck of the Irish _(2001)**  
This coming-of-age story about an Irish-American kid who hits puberty and becomes a _leprechaun _is a purely cuckoo-bananas venture in the vein of _Thirteenth Year, _bless its heart. His hair turns red and his ears turn pointy and he becomes very small, which is a problem because he plays basketball, and his grandfather is an evil leprechaun named Reilly O’Reilly, and … actually, is this movie super-offensive to Irish-Americans? Feels like it, but it’s worth it.
**27\. _Ring of Endless Light _(2002)**  
Mischa Barton can talk to dolphins in this masterpiece.
**26\. _Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam _(2010)**  
In some ways, _Camp Rock 2 _is better than the first movie. It’s much goofier in tone, it features that great sequence where they’re all marching in a line chanting “Camp Rock!” and doing that hand-choreo, and it operates more like an actual musical, with songs that tiptoe on that touchy diegetic performance line. Lots of funny cutaway stuff with Kevin, too.
**25\. _Camp Rock _(2008)**
But _Camp Rock _original flavor ultimately has the upper hand. It has an equally meme-able moment in Alyson Stoner’s impromptu DJ set, and nothing in the sequel reaches the musical heights of Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas singing “This Is Me.”
**24\. _The Swap _(2016)**  
This 2016 girl-boy body-swap comedy is way funnier and more watchable than almost any other DCOM of its 2010s ilk. What it lacks in originality (we didn’t need another hockey movie) it makes up for in good performances by leads Peyton List and Jacob Bertrand,** **good jokes, and rhythmic gymnastics.
**23\. _The Proud Family Movie _(2005)**  
A quadruple-long episode of _Proud Family? _In which Penny Proud actually gets to wear more than one outfit for once? Yes, please. A peanut-obsessed mad scientist named Dr. Carver voiced by Arsenio Hall? _I mean!!!!!!!_
**22\. _Halloweentown _(1998)**  
Debbie _Thee _Reynolds plays the Miss Frizzle–esque grandma to three children who learn they’re part of a powerful magical family in an alternate dimension called _Halloweentown. _Their mom has renounced magic for the real world, but the kids connect with their roots to save the day from an evil(?) mayor(??). The effects are corny, the costumes goofy, but it’s so sincere and full of heart that it’s the rare nostalgia-bomb that works every time. Pairs well with fun-size candies and rainy weather.
**21\. _The Scream Team _(2002)**  
Before I set out to make this list of DCOMs, I had never heard of _The Scream Team, _but it’s somehow an even better Halloweenie movie than _Halloweentown_** **(the first one, anyway). It has an arch sense of humor and a cast of comedy heavy hitters that elevate the material. _[Sex and the City _Bat Mitzvah–girl era Kat Dennings](http://yZwPdPZg_pY) stars alongside Eric Idle, Tommy Davidson, and Kathy Najimy, who are ghosts. If you thought Disney kept its Mickey gloves off the world of the dead, save for the contractually obligated dead parent that every other DCOM protagonist has, you thought wrong. _Scream Team _is all about a band of kids venturing to the afterlife to visit their late grandpa, aided by the help of a corpse bride and disgraced arson ghost. It’s very much in the spirit of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland: It’s Baby’s First Macabre Memento Mori. This would make an excellent double feature with _Hocus Pocus _or the Hillary Duff _Casper, _neither of which, shockingly, are DCOMs.
**20\. _Descendants 3 _(2019)**
Lunacy, just lunacy. _Descendants 3 _completes the descent into madness initiated in the two prequels, but has the best musical numbers of the three by a wide margin. Cheyenne Jackson plays Hades, who is Maleficent’s ex-husband, which is fine if you don’t think too much about it. Dove Cameron gets transformed into an old crone. Son of Beast turns into an effects-makeup nightmare of a demi-beast. Cinderella’s daughter (or something, who cares) sings a song that’s really feeling its _Hamilton _zhuzh, and there’s this whole breakdance number with possessed suits of armor that has to be seen to be believed/reviled. The gay undertones between the sons of Jafar and Gaston are overtones. Mulan becomes captain of the school fencing team. Bobby Moynihan voices a talking dog named “Dude.” There is a teen wedding. This also was the first Cameron Boyce posthumous release after his untimely death at age 20, so it’s a little bittersweet. May Kenny Ortega continue to direct wacky shit forever and ever.
**19\. _Johnny Tsunami _(1999)**  
A young teen with a passion for surfing moves from Hawaii to chilly Vermont, where he takes his skills to the slopes as a snowboarder. The snobs-vs.-slobs, preps-vs.-townies dynamic at play between the private-school skiers and the public-school boarders is an old formula done well, and the whole thing is aided by its lead’s sweet, cheery, performance. Good DCOM.
**18\. _Lemonade Mouth _(2011)**  
Hayley Kiyoko! In a DCOM! About a very G-rated, musical version of the _Breakfast Club! _Misfits meet in detention and start a counterculture rock band that releases a bop called “Determinate.” What’s their revolutionary cause? Saving the lemonade machine in the school basement! It lands them in _jail, _folks. This movie is played so earnest that it will win you over if you let it. It’s streets ahead of _Camp Rock, _even without Demi’s star power.
**17\. _Jump In! _(2007)**  
Corbin Bleu plays a boxer who enters the world of competitive double Dutch and joins forces with Keke Palmer. Unlike some other sports-centric DCOMs, _Jump In _is fun to watch because competitive double Dutch is mesmerizing. And unlike other DCOMs in general, the performances and filmmaking are actually good.
**16\. _Brink _(1998)**
The Dimes Square VFiles sk8r-boi aesthetic owes _eeeeeverything _to _Brink! _And Erik von Detten should demand credit where it’s due. This story about SoCal inline-skating teens and dueling sponsorship offers is just a whole cheerful mood and will take you out of your 2020 woes to a simpler time, when pop punk reigned.
**15\. _The Color of Friendship _(2000)**  
I defy you to name a better children’s movie about South African apartheid. Based on a true story, this DCOM about a girl from South Africa who stays on exchange with an African-American family is a startlingly clear look at racism. It’s a DCOM that’s not afraid to go _allllll _the way there.
**14\. _Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior _(2006)**  
After years and years of playing the sidekick, Brenda Song finally got her leading role. And what a role it was! A charming, popular girlie-girl who becomes the “chosen one,” a Yin warrior who has to fight off an ancient dragon demon. It’s my favorite formula, which is to say, the _Buffy _one. Add a subplot about getting back in touch with your heritage as a third-generation Chinese-American girl, _and _Brenda Song having to juggle warrior training with campaigning for homecoming queen, and you’ve got a rock solid DCOM.
**13\. _Get a Clue _(2002)**  
Yet another top-20-worthy Brenda Song joint, but one where even she, the queen of DCOMs, is overshadowed by Lindsay Lohan, who in 2002, by my recollection, was more famous than the actual moon. Lohan plays Lexy Gold, a precocious tween who wears Prada to class in middle school and has the scoop on everyone’s business as the school newspaper’s advice columnist. Basically a mini Manhattanite Cher Horowitz with Brenda as her Dionne, the two get all up in the adults’ business and solve a $10 million scandal. There is a chair shaped like a giant stiletto and too much fabulous early-2000s tech.
**12\. _Halloweentown II: Kalabar’s Revenge _(2001)**  
This _Halloweentown _sequel is, I’ll say it, even better than the first one. When Halloweentown is blasted with a spell that makes everyone boring, the Piper siblings and Debbie Reynolds have to save the day. They do this by reenacting the _Buffy _episode where everyone is turned into their Halloween costumes.
**11\. _Full-Court Miracle _(2003)**  
_Full-Court Miracle _is straight-up S-tier iconic because it’s literally one of the only movies in the history of American cinema to depict modern Jewish day school. Like _Uncut Gems _after it, _Full-Court Miracle _dares to ask the question: What _is_ it with Jewish boys and basketball? Also, and this is what always got me, it acknowledges the blunt reality that it would take a_ literal Hanukkah miracle _for a team of Jewish kids to beat literally any other middle school in basketball. Between _Full-Court Miracle _and the phenomenal Ramadan and Kwanzaa episodes of _Proud Family, _early 2000s Disney Channel led the charge on the “Did you know there are holidays besides Christmas?” front.
**10\. _Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century _(1999)**
Zoom, zoom zoom! This movie about a girl who lives on a space station with her best friend, Raven, in the distant 21st century is Alpha Major. Can you believe the writers of this movie really thought that in the 21st century, students would learn on screens, via remote teaching? What a concept. The space station at the center of _Zenon _is like sci-fi Hogwarts, with kids running around restricted rooms full of bleeps and bloops and using pre-iPad iPads (space magic!) to pre-FaceTime FaceTime with a cute Earth boy. The plot about the pitfalls of private-company-owned space exploration (hi, Elon) and British boy-band fandom still rings true today Space in general terrifies me, but _Zenon_ made it seem like an endless sleepover. The _real _frighteningly vast frontier where no one can hear you scream, at least in _Zenon, _is Vancouver.** **
**9\. _High School Musical 2 _(2007)**  
“Bet On It.” “Fabulous.” “What Time Is It? (Summer Time).” The bops simply refuse to stop in _High School Musical 2. _Some might even say they bop … to the top. After the fateful events of _High School Musical, _the gang all get jobs at truly the nicest country club you have ever seen in your life, which is of course owned by Sharpay and Ryan’s family. The movie is so much more heightened and ridiculous than the first. The bright swimming-pool blues and golf-course greens are a damn near assault on the eyes. It’s so much fun.
**8\. _Cheetah Girls _(2003)**  
Galleria. Chanel. Aqua. Dorinda. These aren’t the names of upscale outdoor malls. They aren’t the cast of a new _Real Housewives _offshoot. They are four best friends in New York City who wear coordinated Baskin print and write the best pop of their generation. The first _Cheetah Girls _is surprisingly more grounded than you might remember. Raven plays lead cheetah Galleria like an anti-hero; she’s legitimately terrible to her friends for a lot of the movie, and it’s an interesting dynamic for a DCOM lead. Dorinda lies about being a foster child. Chanel (Adrienne Bailon) has a single mom who loves her but pays more attention to the men she’s seeing. Aqua … is from Texas and is scared to ride the subway. Oh, and there’s a plot about the recording industry that plays like _Josie and the Pussycats _lite_. _That comparison is the highest praise I can give.
**7\. _Stuck in the Suburbs _(2004)**  
More! Brenda! Song! Hell! Yeah! She plays the phenomenally named Natasha Kwon-Schwartz, who is the sidekick to Danielle Panabaker’s lead, which is incorrect math, but whatever. The teens long for a more exciting life than their suburban existence, and find it through a swapped-cell-phone mix-up with pop star–hunk Jordan Cahill, played by _Taran Killam_.** **Along the way, Panabaker and Song have some of the more believable friend drama in a DCOM when it’s revealed that new girl in school Song was lying about her globetrotting, pre-suburban life to impress Panabaker’s other friends. There’s also a B-plot about trying to preserve the one historic house in the bland suburb. Most of the pleasures of this movie, though, are purely nostalgic: for mid-2000s pop, mid-2000s cell phones, and mid-2000s Limited Too accessories.** **Taran Killam’s music videos for “More Than Me” and “Make a Wish” are better pop satire than _Never Stop Never Stopping. _Taran _defined an era _here.** **
**6\. _Cheetah Girls 2 _(2006)**
_Cheetah Girls 2 _feels fabulously, deliriously expensive for a DCOM. The sequel sees the Cheetahs traveling to Barcelona and breaking out into song at every opportunity, and this tilt away from realism toward a full-blown musical travelogue gives it a slight edge of the original. Giving all the cheetahs cute Spanish love interests and a rival Eurovision dance-mom villain are just smart moves all around. Also, it’s produced by Whitney Houston_. _As in, Whitney Houston! The whole thing lights up the same pleasure centers in my brain as other Euro-musical delights like _The_ _Lizzie McGuire Movie, Mamma Mia, _and the ending of _Shrek 2._
**5\. _Pixel Perfect _(2004)**  
Every single episode of _Black Mirror _wants what _Pixel Perfect _has. Ricky Ullman from _Phil of the Future _plays a tech whiz who programs a perfect hologram girl named Loretta to play in his best friend Sam’s band. The songs are earworms that will stick with you for 16 years. Loretta’s post-human perfection includes doing impossible backflips and choreo onstage. The romantic tension between Sam, Ricky, and Loretta is _felt. _And when Loretta sacrifices herself for Sam, it makes _Blade Runner _look like, well, like a piece of shit in comparison.
**4\. _Cadet Kelly _(2002)**  
_Cadet Kelly _gave the children of the year 2002 everything they could possibly want with this story of an arty cool teen played by Hilary Duff who single-handedly tries to bring down the military-industrial complex, mostly by being a bossy bottom to her military school’s drill sergeant Christy Carlson Romano. By the end of the movie, after multiple sexually charged dance-offs, the two learn to merge their gifts by blending the majesty of drill team with the lyrical beauty of ribbon dancing. Yes, this movie has a climax centered around ribbon dancing. _Cadet Kelly _holds up on rewatch decades later as a charming, funny classic of the era, with lots of positive anti-authoritarian messages about being yourself, and how liking N*SYNC and making bracelets doesn’t make a person any less virtuous than someone who does Tough Mudders for fun (okay, maybe I’m projecting). Hilary and Christy are giants of Disney Channel lore. Oh, and the mom is played by the Philadelphia Cream Cheese angel, if you want even more of a throwback. There’s a reason why this one was a sleepover favorite and a core text of queer-girl canon.
**3\. _Smart House _(1999)**  
_Pixel Perfect _is one thing. _Black Mirror _couldn’t even deign to dream of reaching the heights of _Smart House. _A family suffers the loss of their mother and moves into a technology-equipped smart home that develops the personality of a ’50s-sitcom housewife, the voice of Leela from _Futurama, _and the evil-robot desire to control the family forever. I don’t know if there will ever be a house party onscreen again as cool as the one in _Smart House; _the teens came up with choreo and everything. LeVar Burton directed this!
**2\. _Teen Beach Movie _(2013)**  
A lot of this top-ten section is greatest aughties nostalgia hits, but allow me to direct your attention to this 2013 bopperoni of a later-era DCOM for a moment. Ross Lynch (a damn_ star_) and Maia Mitchell play Brady and Mack, boyfriend and girlfriend surfer kids who go for a ride on an enchanted surfboard that washes them ashore in a 1960s _Beach Blanket Bingo–_style campfest of a movie-within-a-movie called “Wet_ Side Story._” Practical-headed Mack is confused by the internal logic at play, as was I the first two or three times I watched _Teen Beach Movie,_ but goofy Brady flips gender convention on its head by being a massive fan of musicals. He knows all the plot beats, but there’s one hitch: Mack has been teaching all of these 1960s movie-character girls feminism (oh, _no!_) and now the fabric of the movie universe is starting to disintegrate! It’s like _Purple Rose of Cairo _meets _Back to the Future _meets an Old Navy commercial meets … a Disney Channel Original Movie. Garrett Clayton and Jordan Fisher round out the cast as singing human Ken dolls. What makes _Teen Beach Movie _succeed where other DCOMs fail is that it doesn’t for a second try to tap into those ever-fickle _hip tween trends, _sticking instead to its very bizarre guns. This is an original movie that aired on Disney Channel in which bikers do pirouettes and sing about being “wrapped in leather, ready to go,” and people need to be made aware of its existence.
**1\. _High School Musical _(2006)**
The GOAT, and it wasn’t even close. _High School Musical _imprinted so strongly on my tween brain that there was a time in my childhood that I lost the ability to do long division but _gained _the ability to recite this perfect DCOM_ _start to finish. Here was the movie that led to _Glee_, which led to _Pitch Perfect, _which led to Rebel Wilson in _Cats._ It launched the careers of Zac Efron and Coachella queen Vanessa Hudgens. It centers around a villain whose only motivation is wanting desperately for her and her fraternal-twin brother to be cast as romantic leads opposite each other in front of their entire school. It gave us a rhythmic basketball-dribbling number, cafeteria-tray choreography, and the legendary Miss Darbus screaming things like “I will not allow my twinkle-toes musicale to be turned into a farce!” while swishing multiple scarves. DCOMs stumble when they aspire to things they can never truly be, like “real” or “cool.” But when they own up to exactly what they are and what they want to be and stay true to themselves, much like Troy Bolton, there’s not a star in heaven that they can’t reach.
