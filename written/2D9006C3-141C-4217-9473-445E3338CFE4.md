Double Tap is the show where blind people talk tech! If youâ€™re blind or partially sighted and have an interest in technology, this is the show for you. Everyone is welcome no matter how old you are or how much or how little experience you have with technology. Each week the team will help you better understand how technology can help your everyday life, even if you have little or no sight.

Join the conversation and add your voice to the show either by calling in, sending an email or leaving us a voicemail!
