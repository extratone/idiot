‪most feedback I’ve gotten about my own work for the past two years has been concern with its self-awareness, so let me just clarify now that any modesty of mine is false and put on entirely by design to conceal how clever, interesting, and original I think I am - so much so that I think being publicly conceited is beneath me.

that’s why I do it and why I share it and I’m about to do it and share it a whole lot more.
‪now you know.
