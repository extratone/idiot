# Unsplash > Snap.as Shortcut (iOS/iPadOS/Mac)
- [Unsplash > Snap.as Shortcut (iOS/iPadOS/Mac)](https://discuss.write.as/t/unsplash-snap-as-shortcut-ios-ipados-mac/5285)
This one requires you have the [Snap.as Upload shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11616/) by @DavidBlue  installed as it calls it in this shortcut. I have that info as a separate comment in the shortcut header as well.

[Unsplash ➡️ Snap.as](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e06d69a699fa4261a4c290d7d32c27ed)

Shortcut Description:

Search for an image on Unsplash, or let it provide one at random. It previews it, tap Done to move on or tap outside the preview window to end the shortcut. 

Done button on preview will resize to a 960px width image and upload to Snap.as via another shortcut (see next Comment for details). 

What gets copied to the clipboard is a Markdown image link. In the case of images you searched for, the search term is passed into the alt text for the Markdown link. 

If you have the Writefreely iOS app installed, the Open Write.as option in the menu afyer upload will launch that. Seemed like a natural flow. 

Other options presented are pretty self-explanatory.
