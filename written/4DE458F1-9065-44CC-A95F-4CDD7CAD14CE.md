this freedom was one I valued very much and also didn't want to "lose," necessarily, despite recognizing how absurdly untenable it would immediately become if I ever lived in any other situation. I understood this *legally*, yes - back then, you could absolutely face legal consequences for screwing around with a firearm in any public setting (in Missouri) unless you were doing so for the purposes of *transporting* it, and had secured it so appropriately.

as someone who was enthusiastic about guns and surrounding by people constantly blabbing on about whether or not they might be taken away, I generally *acknowledged* the likelihood that buying straight up tactical shit was not going to be legal fairly soon, and that this was kind of fucking inevitable???? when I 

despite the fact that the vast majority of those people's gun ownership was 100% *symbolic*. how many of those motherfuckers actually invested the (ridiculously minimal) effort/time it takes to maintain the objects, themselves, but more importantly, the most BASAL competency required to handle things fundmentally designed to be good at ending life.
