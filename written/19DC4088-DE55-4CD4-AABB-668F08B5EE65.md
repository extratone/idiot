## Post content via the Write.as API.

This shortcut allows the user to post to [Write.as](https://write.as/join/4bqc8482) via [the Write.as API](https://developers.write.as/docs/api). Upon installation, you’ll be prompted to set your Write.as/Snap.as auth token, which you can obtain with [my Authenticate with WriteFreely shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11589/) if you’d like. By default, you’ll be prompted to explicitly declare the title of the post per each run.

If the interaction is successful, the resulting post will be opened in Safari and its URL will be copied to the clipboard.
