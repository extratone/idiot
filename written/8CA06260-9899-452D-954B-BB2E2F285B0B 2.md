## These two Base64-Bound Baddies might simplify your yuppie existence for another few weeks.​

Somehow, I managed to find myself in possession of two Very Large image files: the(?) new dark/light wallpaper pair coming in macOS Ventura. (Here they are in full, [**light**](https://davidblue.wtf/ventura/venturalight.jpg) and [**dark**](https://davidblue.wtf/ventura/venturadark.jpg), so we've got that out of the way.) I don't actually remember where they came from, so I hope that doesn't matter much to you. (Maybe don't contact me if it actually does lol.)

Anyhow, I've actually had them for quite a while, but I've been meaning to do what I'm trying to tell you about for far, *far* longer. Basically, files (like images) can be stored within single Siri Shortcuts entirely in plaintext form thanks to the magic of [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) and the now quite familiar [Base64 Encode](https://matthewcassinelli.com/actions/base64-encode/) action. I've been meaning to """"ǝ ƃ ɐ ɹ ǝ ʌ ǝ l"""" this capability to simplify my own, sick, superficial, yet craven need to cycle through inordinately huge image files as my desktop backgrounds/*wallpaper* for literally years, now, but I finally just fucking did it, all for you.

They're very simple (3 whole actions!) but **please keep in mind that they are also gargantuan**. Since I'm super smart in a way I definitely love very much, I happen to know that *all* of one's Siri Shortcuts are actually stored in a single sqlite file that is constantly being prodded every which way by iCloud Drive's mania... Keeping these around is not going to help.
