# Chapter 1: Krash Course
To start, I’d like to riff off some of the core considerations you’ll encounter if - somehow - this guide is introducing you to the whole concept of using a Bluetooth keyboard paired with your iPhone and you’re ready to just try it. First, do not bother looking to Apple, itself, for documentation about how to “get started.” I would also advise you generally stick to this guide (unless you’re reading an outdated version in the future) and avoid the intermittent acknowledgements/mostly halfhearted, very fragmented attempts by greater tech media to document specific keyboard shortcuts per individual apps. For gosh sakes, this guide will have completely failed its primary purpose if it is not infinitely more complete, reliable, and considered than anything you’ll find in a Google search.

At this point, we’re also going to assume you’re using one of two very specific products: Apple’s non-iPad or M1 Mac-Specific Magic Keyboard - either in “full” format (with keypad included,) or otherwise. Additionally, we’re going to assume you’re using the current version of iOS running on a non-jailbroken handset with appropriate support. Would you like to know the system information of *my* particular setup? Too bad, here it is:

Yes, we’re already beginning to talk about actual **Keyboard Shortcuts** from the most essential to least, for the most part, but specifically, I’d like to begin with those that do not behave quite identically to their theoretical touch or on-device hardware input counterparts, the most notable of which is `⌘ + Spacebar`, which calls Spotlight Search on an unlocked iPhone.
