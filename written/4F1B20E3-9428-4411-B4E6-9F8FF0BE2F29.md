# Four Point Oh | Freq Check #15

[ ] The Peach Palette! + more gray spacers to mitigate as-of-yet unavoidably unused space and add a sense of cohesion.
[ ] “New” in Houstonia has been changed to “Fresh,” and an updated section page has been created.
[ ] A changed reading experience with 22px Cormorant??? body text + the long-overdue vanquishing of the unwanted left and right padding.
[ ] “Compromise is an important skill, but it makes for a shitty life philosophy.”
[ ] Why we are *actively* moving in the direction of [confusing, label-less news media](http://www.poynter.org/2017/news-or-opinion-online-its-hard-to-tell/470559/).
[ ] The reading list.
[ ] Nels Nelson’s Future Machine
[ ] Telegram (+added to tip top) + Discord bots +
[ ] A note on Discord’s role’s steadily-increasing importance in the community.
[ ] Google was confused by our ever-changing frontpage, but all should be resolved - a search for “[extratone](https://www.google.com/search?q=extratone)” should have us back on the front page, soon.
[ ] Why Jack Conte’s “Creative Class” is such a dangerous term.

I’d like to extend you a warm welcome to *peachytone -* the reddest magazine on the World Wide Web. *Extranet version four point oh* is here, today - right now… at this very moment - and denotes several key changes and additions - many of which you’ve already seen these past weeks, including - thank God - a site-wide disabling of comments, a refreshed color palette, section visuals & footer, and our darling typography. No, we did not plan the launch in accordance with the solar eclipse, but it’s an awfully-poetic coincidence of reinvention, yes?

Didn’t think us capable of such mysticism? Go read [your horoscope](http://extratone.com/future), bilgeweed.

# Editorially

[*Nels Nelson’s Future Machine*](http://extratone.com/future) is unquestionably the most editorially relevant property we’ve ever absorbed. I’d love to tell you that [August’s](http://extratone.com/horoscopes/august2017) [*horoscope*](http://extratone.com/horoscopes/august2017) was simply a placeholder for the platform until we could find ourselves (where would you even begin?) a Real Life Star Scribe, but it was - in fact - the legitimate, abstract predictions of [Nelson Nelson](http://extratone.com/future) - Creative Director, Hell. 

Consider: **Extratone** - *building beautiful, one-of-a-kind platforms for the cheapest jokes.*

Our dearest *Prose Ghost -* [K. I. Eleutherios XVII](http://extratone.com/eleu) - wrote both of our features, this month: [*The Truth About Kayaks*](http://bit.ly/kayaktruth), and [*The Ven*](http://bit.ly/veneat) *-* neither of which were true, in the slightest, nor marked as such in any way. ([Oops](http://www.poynter.org/2017/news-or-opinion-online-its-hard-to-tell/470559/). Sorry.) Honestly, though, do you *actually* need to be explicitly told whether or not what you’re reading/watching is satire, in this climate. *Can you*, even?

*Is this a joke?*

I don’t know. Does it matter?

Actually, yes, it does, when you’re throwing around threats of violence, like my [announcement](http://bit.ly/guspledge) and “pledge drive” a few weeks ago claiming I’d kill a small, pitiful cocker-spaniel if we did not gain five subscribers in 5 hours.  As I explained in my [*super-New-Media-Medium-Post*](https://medium.com/@FickleCrux/the-dog-is-a-live-1819bd74a348), I was genuinely surprised at how negatively many readers, friends, and staff reacted.

Obviously, My Post wouldn’t be difficult to classify as an *apology*, per se, but a sort of rant out of one genuine sentiment: *really, dude?* You think I’m *actually* threatening to hurt an animal for *patrons*??!! Blame’s not relevant, but I know *for a fact* that y’all are smarter than that. 

I’m still not quite sure how to respond, and with just my limited life experience, I know that all attempts to parse misunderstandings of this nature lead to unnecessary - and often, highly unpleasant - bouts of silent seething, rejection, and/or general passive aggression. The thing is - being “misunderstood” is not a disease - it is a result of your poor ability to communicate yourself and your ideas. Children throw *tantrums* when they’re frustrated with their inability to communicate - you wouldn’t be wrong to suggest that my decision to behave this way was nothing but an *edgy*, Big Boy equivalent, and you won’t see anything like it again, from us. *(It should also be noted that neither Hawthorn nor Tim condoned it, particularly, so it’s a* ***confirmed blunder****, regardless of anything.)*

Though that’s not quite all of it, I’m afraid - I *was* trying to argue a position, and - despite how foully I went about it - it *is* a pillar of Extratone’s existence. When I happened to glance at my [*Recode Media*](https://www.recode.net/2017/8/10/16115548/patreon-jack-conte-fan-pledges-subscription-paywall-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast) feed to see Jack Conte’s name, I was embarrassingly giddy. Peter Kafka is perhaps the best media reporter ever to grease the stale annals of insider-industry culture and his opposite embodies the *w h i t e  c r e a t i v e  s t a r t u p.*
