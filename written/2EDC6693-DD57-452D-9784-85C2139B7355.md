*Wow... So sorry about that first take, town. It looks like this is going to be a zero-media blog, which will probably be really good for me, actually.*

Maybe just a timestamp for a title, how about that? (Btw, all my timestamps are in [DavodTime](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/DavodTime),™ which is not actually trademarked.) 

Hello again, Town. Since I last posted here, I’ve actually engaged in the forum, written a wee bit at the end of [Town Graffiti](https://tilde.town/graffiti.html), and even engaged some with Town Chat. I’ve also updated [my page](https://tilde.town/~extratone) quite extensively with all sorts of local links. A Mastodon friend called my [App Store reviews index](https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews) a “really cool idea,” but it actually reflects an inexcusable level of negligence, on my part.

As always, I’m working on far too many things at once, and I definitely do not want This Post to become another one. Perhaps I should ban hyperlinks in the future? I don’t know... here’s a hyperlink to where you can respond: p̯e̶ḝ̴̸̡̢̦͖̺̐͟͢͞͞.

So, so many years have passed since the last time I spent any extended periods sitting in an IRC chat. I’m sure you’ve heard that a billion times, but - unlike most other modern chat settings, imo - I think TildeTown is one of the few places where IRC genuinely makes sense over any other protocol. In [my in-progress guide](https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink) to using [Blink Shell](https://testflight.apple.com/v1/app/1156707581) with Tilde.Town, I described WeeChat’s “onboarding process” (forgive me) as *dubitable* (see below.) 

> The IRC client TildeTown uses is called [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve [duplicated the full User Guide](https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/) for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running `/buffer 1` followed by `help`.

Before removing the images from this post and re-uploading it, I added [the primer](https://tilde.town/~extratone/pfwtl) for my work-in-progress Public Domain-equivalent content license (which is both every bit as much of a joke as it seems and yet also intended for actual use,) a [dedicated root directory](https://tilde.town/~extratone/ed) for the full ed manual, and [another](https://tilde.town/~extratone/wfios) for a duplicate of the WriteFreely for iOS app’s documentation.

You might have noticed - I also overwrote the CSS for this blog completely with a direct copy-and-paste from [*The Psalms*’ CSS](https://bilge.world/colophon). Feel free to publicly berate me regarding this decision, as always.
