## Gerald Lynch, Editor-in-Chief

Gerald Lynch is the Editor-in-Chief of iMore, keeping careful watch over the site's editorial output and commercial campaigns, ensuring iMore delivers the in-depth, accurate and timely Apple content its readership deservedly expects. You'll never see him without his iPad Pro, and he loves gaming sessions with his Game Center buddies via Apple Arcade on his iPhone 13 Pro, but don't expect him to play with you at home unless your Apple TV is hooked up to a 4K HDR screen and a 7.1 surround system.

Living in London in the UK, Gerald was previously Editor of Gizmodo UK, and Executive Editor of TechRadar, and has covered international trade shows including Apple's WWDC, MWC, CES and IFA. If it has an acronym and an app, he's probably been there, on the front lines reporting on the latest tech innovations.

Gerald is also a regularly contributing tech pundit for BBC Radio and in the past has written for various other print and online publications, including T3 magazine, GamesRadar, Space.com, Real Homes, MacFormat, music bible DIY, Tech Digest, TopTenReviews, Mirror.co.uk, Brandish, Kotaku, Shiny Shiny and Lifehacker. Gerald also holds a Guinness world record on Tetris.

He is also the author of 'Get Technology: Upgrade Your Future', published by Aurum Press. Gerald is a big reader, studying English Literature at Goldsmiths, University of London, plays guitar, and knows his way around a virtual reality headset. Gerald dreams of the day when he can pop on an Apple VR headset and meet Lawnmower Man-era Pierce Brosnan. Sadly, Pierce doesn't share the dream.

Christine is an expert at all things iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. She lives on these devices at all times throughout her life, so she knows a thing or two about how they work and how to fix things if something goes wrong. When she's not diving into the ins-and-outs of her devices, she's always looking for the latest hot new apps, games, and Apple-related accessories to check out. And for those times she's not writing, she's out taking photos with her iPhone, playing video games, or enjoying time at Disneyland with her husband.

Luke still has a working Atari 2600 in his basement; when he isn't writing about apps or games, you'll probably find him slapping the bass to his favorite 80s tunes.

Tammy Rogers Headshot (Image credit: Tammy Rogers)

As the Buying Guides and Deals writer for iMore, Tammy puts over a decade of experience in finding the best prices of Apple products to work, helping you save money on the equipment that you want. An audiophile at heart, she’s still rocking an iPod video, and with her trusty old MacBook Pro by her side, she spends far too much time writing. Don’t ask her what she thinks of the AirPods Max - you probably won’t like her answer.

With a Masters in screenwriting, her love for words and story puts her in a great place to deliver engaging guides. Her hard drive is filled to the brim with short stories and screenplays - most of which will never see the light of day again. Tammy would like to replicate the shared cockpit scene from Top Gun, only with Lewis Hamilton in an F1 car. Lewis is yet to reply to her emails.
