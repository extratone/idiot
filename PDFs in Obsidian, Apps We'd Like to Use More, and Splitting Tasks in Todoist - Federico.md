## [PDFs in Obsidian, Apps We'd Like to Use More, and Splitting Tasks in Todoist](https://club.macstories.net/posts/spotlight-on-club-macstories)

It was a busy week on the Club MacStories+ Discord, and I’ve tried my best to collect highlights from the community below. There isn’t a Discord URL scheme to reopen these links in the Discord app directly; my preferred approach for these is to view them as separate tabs in Safari for iPad or Mac.

Member Cris [shared a tip](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345891497017344/880587691056594964) on how to embed attachments, such as PDFs, in Obsidian to create a portable, searchable index of important documents.

If you’re a web developer, you’ll want to check out [Alex’s explanation of Docker and Kubernetes](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549358343442523/881233019778793512).

[Devon asked a question](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345707395907635/882096515269677146) that generated an interesting thread in the #apps channel: what are apps you really like but don’t have any practical use for? I thought I was alone with this “problem”; turns out I’m not.

In the #obsidian channel, I explained how I created a keyboard command that [lays out a particular workspace for me](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/882355226026319922) using the QuickAdd plugin. I also [shared a demo shortcut](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/882356377434091520) to dictate text and append it to your daily note.

Following a tip I shared on how to replicate Things’ Morning/Evening task structure with Reminders smart lists in iOS 15, member Daniel shared how [he created a similar system in Todoist](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345891497017344/883025466800349205) using tags and custom sorting. Daniel also [shared the full syntax](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345891497017344/883043303375900682) he’s using for the Todoist filter here. I am absolutely going to steal Daniel’s approach.
