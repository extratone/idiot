## [A Prepend to Dashboard Shortcut, A New Way to Get Matter's API Token, and an Advanced Template Script for Obsidian](https://club.macstories.net/posts/a-prepend-to-dashboard-shortcut-a-new-way-to-get-matters-api-token-and-an-advanced-template-script-for-obsidian)

Here are the highlights from the Club MacStories Discord this week. Our members have been having fun with Obsidian lately:

Following a request by a member, I created a simplified version of my [Append to Dashboard shortcut](https://club.macstories.net/posts/shortcuts-essentials) that [always inserts text at the beginning of a specific section](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/946787303722987621) of a note in Obsidian, without displaying any prompts to the user.

Member Tolva took my reverse-engineering [experiments](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-starter-pack-reverse-engineering-the-matter-api-and-my-save-to-matter-shortcut/) with the Matter API even further and [came up with a system](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345683550765157/944653251377233950) to grab a Matter API token without having to use the Obsidian plugin. He also shared a shortcut that makes this process easy.

Sam [shared a Templater script](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/946448092901814282) to create a folder with sub-folders and notes inside.
