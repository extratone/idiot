## [An Update to Save YouTube Link, a Technique for Updating Obsidian YAML with a Single Hotkey, and an AirBuddy Shortcut](https://club.macstories.net/posts/an-update-to-save-youtube-link-a-technique-for-updating-obsidian-yaml-with-a-single-hotkey-and-an-airbuddy-shortcut)

It was a busy week on the Club MacStories+ Discord, and I’ve tried my best to collect highlights from the community below. There isn’t a Discord URL scheme to reopen these links in the Discord app directly; my preferred approach for these is to view them as separate tabs in Safari for iPad or Mac.

Following some bug reports by members, I [posted](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/935646293714415707) an updated version of my Save YouTube Link shortcut that supports more types of video titles. You can also redownload it [here](https://club.macstories.net/posts/obsidian-setup-part-7).

Member dfjones figured out something I always wanted to have: a combination of QuickAdd and JavaScript to [update YAML metadata values in Obsidian](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/880549416765898772/936025238561497169) with a single hotkey or push of a button, without any UI. Unfortunately, a bug prevents this from [working on iOS right now](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/issues/79).

Member Dan [has shared a shortcut](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837346027144347700/934181172563546124) that uses AirBuddy’s actions to check the firmware of your AirPods against the latest public release.
