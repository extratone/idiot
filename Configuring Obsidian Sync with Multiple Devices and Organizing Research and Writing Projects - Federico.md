## [Configuring Obsidian Sync with Multiple Devices and Organizing Research and Writing Projects](https://club.macstories.net/posts/configuring-obsidian-sync-with-multiple-devices-and-organizing-research-and-writing-projects)

Here are the highlights from the Club MacStories Discord this week:

Nicolas [shared a great tip](https://club.macstories.net/discord/880549416765898772/962640096169959454) on how to properly configure Obsidian Sync on multiple devices if you’re storing the vault locally.

Speaking of Obsidian, [Mitch asked](https://club.macstories.net/discord/880549416765898772/964220084505673748) about how we organize writing projects in the app, and both John and I shared a few thoughts. I encourage other Obsidian users to chime in as I’m always interested in how others manage their drafts and research material.
