hey guyyyys..... I thought I was keeping up, generally with GitHub... but I had no idea GitHub Codespaces were just *full VS Code in-the-browser*.

...they're open to anybody on any repo. all you have to do is hit `.` (period.)

... and ya know... I use my iPhone with a keyboard... and it has a period key.
