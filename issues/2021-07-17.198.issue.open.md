Microsoft is improving some of the built-in apps available in Windows 11. Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel can now test new updates to the Snipping Tool, Calculator, Mail, and Calendar apps. Some of the updates are minor, but all are designed to match the new visual style in Windows 11.

Microsoft is replacing the classic Snipping Tool and Snip & Sketch apps in Windows 11 with a new Snipping Tool app that combines the best features of both apps. The Win + Shift + S keyboard shortcut will be the main way to take a screenshot in Windows 11, and it will activate the snipping menu with various options for selecting what content to screenshot.

![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1gmStscFj4o5YpBPK38jOoN3fg=/0x0:682x298/1200x0/filters:focal\(0x0:682x298\):no_upscale\(\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778653/SnippingDark.png) _The updated Snipping Tool now has a dark mode._ Image: Microsoft

Once a screenshot has been taken, the Snipping Tool includes edit options for cropping, annotations, and more. Microsoft is even finally adding a dark mode to the Snipping Tool, so it’ll match your Windows 11 theme.

Microsoft is also updating its Mail and Calendar apps in Windows 11 to match the operating system’s new visual style. “We have added rounded corners and other adjustments to make them look and feel part of Windows 11,” [says Dave Grochocki](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/12/first-set-of-windows-app-updates-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders-for-windows-11/), a senior program manager lead for Windows inbox apps.

The calculator app in Windows 11 is also getting some minor improvements that will let you set a separate theme to the one you’re using in the rest of Windows. Microsoft has also rewritten the calculator in C#, allowing developers to contribute to its improvements [over on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator).

Finally, Windows 11 testers can now try out one-to-one and group audio or video calling in Microsoft Teams. You can also share your screen, just as you would in the regular Microsoft Teams app.

These aren’t the only apps that will be updated for Windows 11. Grochocki’s blog post teases more to come as Microsoft looks to finalize Windows 11 in time for its [(likely) October release](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor).

Microsoft is announcing that Windows 11 will be released on October 5th. The new operating system will be available as a free upgrade for eligible Windows 10 PCs, or on new hardware that ships with Windows 11 pre-loaded.

The free upgrade to Windows 11 will start rolling out on October 5th, but like many Windows upgrades in the past, it will be available in phases. New eligible devices will be offered the upgrade first, and then Windows 11 will become available for more in-market devices in the weeks and months following October 5th.

“Following the tremendous learnings from Windows 10, we want to make sure we’re providing you with the best possible experience,” [explains Aaron Woodman](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176111), general manager of Windows marketing at Microsoft. “We expect all eligible devices to be offered the free upgrade to Windows 11 by mid-2022.”

On existing Windows 10 PCs, Windows Update will let people know when the upgrade is available for Windows 11. You can also check to see if your device is eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade through Windows Update, or Microsoft’s dedicated PC Health Check app ([currently in preview](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=\[\]vg\[p\]22413981\[t\]w\[d\]M&murl=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewpchealth)).

While Windows 11 will be launching on October 5th, not all of the announced features will be available. Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11 in partnership with Amazon and Intel, but this feature [won’t be available on October 5th](https://www.theverge.com/e/22414041). A preview of Android apps on Windows 11 will be available for Windows Insiders in the coming months, suggesting that it likely won’t launch to all Windows 11 users until 2022.

Microsoft clarified its minimum system requirements for Windows 11 last week, but also revealed a workaround for those who don’t meet them. [You can install Windows 11 on any hardware](https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes) using an ISO method, as long as the PC has a 64-bit 1GHz processor with two or more cores, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a TPM 1.2 chip. But if you use the workaround, your PC will be in an unsupported state. This means an unsupported Windows 11 PC might not get access to Windows Update, and even security patches.

If your PC isn’t fully compatible with Windows 11, Microsoft is still supporting Windows 10 until October 14th, 2025. It’s not clear how many major updates Microsoft will release for Windows 10 over the next four years, though. A [21H2 update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/07/15/introducing-the-next-feature-update-to-windows-10-21h2/) is arriving for Windows 10 users later this year that includes GPU compute support in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Windows Hello improvements, and WPA3 H2E Wi-Fi security support.

### **Thank you to the Windows Insider Community**

The Windows Insider community has been an invaluable community in helping us get to where we are today. Since the [first Insider Preview Build was released in June](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/28/announcing-the-first-insider-preview-for-windows-11/), the engagement and feedback has been unprecedented. The team has also enjoyed sharing more behind the scenes stories on the development of Windows 11 in a new series we launched in June, [Inside Windows 11](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/insidewindows11). We sincerely appreciate the energy and enthusiasm from this community.

### **Rolling out the free upgrade to Windows 11 in a phased and measured approach**

The free upgrade to Windows 11 starts on October 5 and will be phased and measured with a focus on quality. Following the tremendous learnings from Windows 10, we want to make sure we’re providing you with the best possible experience. That means new eligible devices will be offered the upgrade first. The upgrade will then roll out over time to in-market devices based on intelligence models that consider hardware eligibility, reliability metrics, age of device and other factors that impact the upgrade experience. We expect all eligible devices to be offered the free upgrade to Windows 11 by mid-2022. If you have a Windows 10 PC that’s eligible for the upgrade, Windows Update will let you know when it’s available. You can also check to see if Windows 11 is ready for your device by going to Settings > Windows Update and select Check for updates*.

### **Ready to elevate to 11? There’s never been a better time to purchase a new PC**

October 5 is right around the corner — and there are a few things you can do to get ready for Windows 11. First, if you’re in need of a new PC now — don’t wait. You can get all the power and performance of a new Windows 10 PC and upgrade to Windows 11 for free after the rollout begins on October 5**.

We’ve worked closely with our OEM and retail partners to bring you powerful Windows 10 PCs today, that will take you into the future with Windows 11. Here are a few to check out.

### **The first version of a new era of Windows **

As [Panos shared in June](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/introducing-windows-11/), Windows is more than an operating system; it’s where we connect with people, it’s where we learn, work and play. We can’t wait to see what Windows 11 empowers you to do and create.

*_Note, certain features require specific hardware; see our Windows 11 __[specifications page_](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications)_ for more information._

_**The Windows 11 upgrade will start to be delivered to qualifying devices beginning on October 5, 2021 into 2022. Timing varies by device. _

# "[Why can an ad break the Windows 11 desktop and taskbar?](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/windows11-empty-taskbar.html)" Sep 3, 2021 at 12:00
***

Earlier , Microsoft pushed a promotional message to early adopters of Windows 11. The promo intended to promote the upcoming operating system’s integration with Microsoft Teams. Instead, it caused Explorer (the Windows desktop shell) to stop responding and left users without a working Start menu and taskbar.

I was caught up in this problem after restarting my laptop to complete the installation of an unrelated software. It was annoying and frustrating to be left with a broken Windows desktop, but this is what I signed up for as a Windows Insider (early adopter).

Microsoft has acknowledged that there’s an issue and posted [a workaround](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/09/02/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22000-176/) for affected customers. The workaround requires users to open the Registry Editor (regedit) through the Task Manager to make some changes. The company didn’t discuss the problem in detail, however.

I took a closer look at what got downloaded and caused the Windows desktop shell to become unresponsive. Microsoft customers on Twitter and Reddit quickly shared ways to work around the problem and restore the Windows shell. The successful ideas all involved different methods that made the device unable to communicate with Microsoft servers. It became clear that the issue was caused by one of the many cloud services built into Windows.

The problem wasn’t caused by an update delivered through Windows Update. (That would have been more understandable.) Instead, it was caused by a small file downloaded by a Windows component called IrisService. Iris is a part of Windows Spotlight (the Bing wallpaper of the day; and tips, promotions, and suggestions on the Lock screen).

Based on the Microsoft-provided workaround, I narrowed the problem down to a registry key that contained a serialized JSON blob. The blob contained an advertisement for Microsoft Teams. The messaging and imagery in the promotion were identical to [the panel you get](../media/image/windows11-connect-with-teams-panel.png) when you press the Windows key + C on a Windows account not already set up with Teams. It’s unclear if it’s this exact promotion, however.

There’s an enormous elephant in the room, though: how Microsoft could have let this happen? Yes, this is a beta build for early adopters. Yes, rough edges and productivity losses are expected.

However, that doesn’t answer why the Windows shell was so poorly architected in the first place. How come that it would stop responding just because of one failed cloud service? It’s not a crucial cloud service either, and the computer became useless because of a single JSON blob with an advertisement.

Ads in Windows are important to Microsoft. They’re nowhere to be found on the priority lists of Microsoft’s customers. We don’t want them there at all! Millions of people depend on Windows every day, and it simply needs to be more robust than this.

Windows 11 is due for release in October. However, I say it needs to go back on the drawing board. It needs to be rearchitected to decouple it from the cloud. The design requirement is clear: unimportant cloud-dependent systems must be isolated from the core operating system so that they can’t bring the Windows shell to its knees.

I’m not saying Microsoft needs to remove its account, cloud gaming, entertainment, software delivery, and other cloud services. Some of these cloud services do add value to their customers. However, the whole computer can’t grind to a halt over a tiny problem with an unimportant nuisance of a “feature”.
