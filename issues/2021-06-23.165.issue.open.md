# A Tour of All That's Special About Mastodon Clients on iOS (LIVE General Meta)

A Tour of All That's Special About Mastodon Clients on iOS
What? A whole, formalized YouTube Live event just for a single category of iOS apps?

Yeah... Emphasis on the "special" bit.

Unfortunately, this actual YouTube Live event is not the real deal... 

In order to maximize "reach" lol.... I have decided to stream to https://twitch.tv/dieselgoth, first, and then upload the resulting videdo, later.

PLEASE join the Discord - at least for the duration you intend on partici0pating!!! https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP85AyJ9Yo
