Until **November 27th, 2021**, I have a 30-day YouTube Premium trial. It'll be my first time using the tier since very shortly after its original launch, if I'm not mistaken.

YouTube has changed the way it tests new features: it’s now allowing its Premium subscribers access to experimental products in the development pipeline, as first spotted by _[Android Central_.](https://www.androidcentral.com/youll-now-need-have-premium-account-test-upcoming-youtube-features) Previously, those features were tested by Google users picked at random to beta test. 

Currently, [the new features available for Premium subscribers to test](https://www.youtube.com/new) include watching videos with sound and seeking on your YouTube homepage on iOS; voice searching for YouTube videos on-site (only on Chrome); and filtering by topic in additional languages. The language at the top of YouTube’s experimental features page also says that Premium members can only access these features for a limited time. 

[YouTube Premium costs $11.99 a month](https://www.youtube.com/premium), and it also gives you ad-free viewing, background play, and access to YouTube Music, among other features. If you’re a YouTube diehard, though, limited time access to new features might just be worth it.

as a young man with thoughts about streaming services, YouTube formalizing its massive role in music streaming with YouTube Music’s launch in October 2015 sounded like a GREAT idea to me.

so wtf happened? come hang out in 5 hours and share your thoughts. https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1nAKEYNMzRAKL
