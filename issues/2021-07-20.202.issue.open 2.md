# Duplicating My (Overwhelmingly Positive) Mastodon Experience

## Elsewhere
* [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/oodgqe/i_could_literally_offer_an_exact_duplicate_of_my/)

When I’ve gotten other folks to talk at all about their Mastodon experiences, almost all of them have at least one pet happening, personality, or general cultural gripe to cite. I think it’s quickly becoming the prime obstacle in my one-on-one conversations about Mastodon, at least. My personal experience, notably, has been completely exempt of all these experiences I’ve heard so far - I have literally only been compelled to unfollow less than 5 accounts in the round 5 years I’ve been a daily user. Also important: My “social media methodology” is very indiscriminate. I follow anyone who says anything remotely interesting or entertaining as soon as I see it, pretty much, and then *never leave them alone*.

Anyway, it recently occurred to me that I could literally offer *an exact duplicate* of my personal Mastodon experience very easily thanks to Tootsuite’s import/export function. The CSV files of my most recent [**Following** list](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv) and [**Lists**… list](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonlists.csv)… are both now linkable in a public GitHub Repo. 

Hypothetically, I could instruct a potential new user to make a test account and import these files, but - as I understand it - this process would be a pretty significant happening, both for backend server considerations and for actual users involved. I think I can surmise all on my own that it’s probably not something I would offer more than 5-10 people, ever, though as of this moment, my realistic chances of finding a single one actually willing to do it seem all but non existent. 

Obviously, I thought it very important to consult the community, first, for two primary considerations:

1. Is this gonna fucking break everything, admins?
2. Users… potentially those I follow right now who would be followed by a brand new account - along with nearly 700 others across the fediverse - all at once… How do you feel about this? 

Also, howdy forum! <3
