Seriously doubt I'll ever have it in me to write about Bear directly, but I've already collected far too much on it - should have created this issue weeks ago.

The engagement I've had with the Bear Beta community (as well as the normal Subreddit) has always been a profound experience, somehow,. (See #94)
