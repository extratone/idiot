My request for comment across various Discord servers:
> I’d be very interested to hear from some older web users who were around during Microsoft’s EEE days on the potential Discord acquisition.

# What I said in the Apple Scoop Discord

Discord’s been real important to me because I built a media company on it, basically, and… you know… am extremely appreciative of it as someone who used to have to deal with IRC, Ventrilo, Teamspeak, Skype, etc…

I think Microsoft should have bought it a long time ago and tweaked the marketing to include the truth: Discord is a Slack competitor. or at least it should be.

I feel like the only reason Discord hasn’t been recognized as a workplace tool is simply because *they themselves said it was for gamers.* anyone who’s used slack could immediately recognize how Discord could replace it, even way before video and screen sharing.

and I really… hate that lol

I feel like Microsoft is a pretty good steward of its acquisitions, these days, but I don’t think they are capable of fundamentally understanding Discord, tbh.

User Ms1's response:
> They could make like a Discord Work for example as a side App. Or they mix things up to combine Work and Gamer aspects. But maybe they just let Discord be what it is, but I don’t think they would.

Flynn's response:

Yeah that’s true. Honestly though Skype should’ve been a lot more successful than it was under Microsoft, Zoom has definitely taken over these days. I just feel that Microsoft takes over companies and then they kind of lose their innovativeness and what made them great in the first place. But yeah they’ve defo got it right with a few acquisitions so I’m torn
