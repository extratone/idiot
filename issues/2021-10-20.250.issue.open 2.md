> When someone Tweets a Revue profile or newsletter issue, people can subscribe from that Tweet.
If you’ve connected your Twitter account with Revue, you can show your newsletter near the top of your Twitter profile where your followers can easily subscribe. [Learn how to enable this feature.](http://help.getrevue.co/en/articles/5356115-how-to-show-your-newsletter-on-your-twitter-profile)
​
But there are other ways for people to subscribe to your newsletter from Twitter without you needing to adjust a single setting.
​
When someone Tweets a link to a Revue profile or issue, people who see that Tweet in their timeline can subscribe right from that Tweet. Even better: If that person already has an email address linked to their Twitter account, all it takes is one click — no need for them to reconfirm their subscription via email.

If their email isn’t associated with their Twitter account, we'll guide them to your profile page to subscribe.
​
## Generating ‘Subscribe’ buttons in Tweets
​
### Tweeting Revue profiles
​
When composing a Tweet, add the link to your Revue profile at the end and Twitter will automatically generate a link preview that includes a ‘Subscribe’ button.
​
### Tweeting Revue newsletter issues
​
If you want to show a specific issue of your newsletter instead, add the link to the issue you want to show and Twitter will generate a link preview of the issue. When someone clicks through to read the issue, a ‘Subscribe’ button will appear when they return to their timeline.

[Twitter bought out the email newsletter service, Revue](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service), earlier this year, hoping to engage journalists and writers who want to share long-form content without feeling limited by Twitter’s 280 character limit. Now, the newly integrated service is getting an update. 

> We’ve got big news. (You’re really going to like this.)  

> Starting today, your followers can subscribe to Revue newsletters directly from Tweets in their timeline.  

> This is already enabled for all Revue writers on desktop and mobile web, with iOS and Android to follow soon. ✨ [pic.twitter.com/6eBxvGWyxH](https://t.co/6eBxvGWyxH)  

> — Revue (@revue) [October 22, 2021](https://twitter.com/revue/status/1451564116007657472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)   

In a tweet, Revue revealed that users can now subscribe to a newsletter just by clicking on a link in a Tweet. And if a user’s email address is linked to their Twitter account, they can now subscribe with a single click, with no email verification required.

Revue notes that while the feature is currently available to Revue users on desktop and web, it’s set to arrive on Android and iOS in the near future. This comes after [Twitter tested out a newsletter subscription button on users’ profiles](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632414/twitter-newsletter-subscription-button-revue-profile) in August.

Twitter’s acquisition of Revue puts it head-to-head with Substack, a paid newsletter service that helps users establish a following of readers. As Casey Newton notes in [his article on The Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/p/what-i-learned-from-a-year-on-substack), popularity on Substack largely depends on your audience on Twitter. 

> “The only way a Substack grows is through tweets”  

“The only way a Substack grows is through tweets,” Newton said after using the service for a year. “I wish I had other obvious avenues for growth, but to date, it really feels like it’s Twitter or nothing.”

With Revue becoming even more ingrained in Twitter’s interface, one can only imagine the effect this might have on Substack users. Creators may feel more inclined to use Revue instead, thanks to its convenience and the fact that it seamlessly integrates into their tweets and profiles. While you can point readers to your Substack via social media, it may need better promotion options — perhaps some that are built into certain networks. Otherwise, Revue could begin to outpace it.
