Your “About” page and one-line publication description act as welcoming messages to prospective readers. They leave a crucial first impression of what to expect from your writing.

Because these descriptions have such a big impact, the Substack Writer Development team will host a collaborative workshop for writers to craft “About” pages and one-line descriptions that will attract new readers. 

Just because you’re an independent writer, doesn’t mean you have to do this work alone. The Substack writer community is here for you. 

**Join Us!**

-   **Who:** Writers who are currently writing on Substack or exploring doing so
    
-   **What:** Inspiration and best practices from the Substack team, brainstorming with fellow writers
