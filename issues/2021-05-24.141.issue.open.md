## Link/Reading List Curation and Exploring Beyond

Raindrop has added **embed** support and **redesigned public pages support**!! As such, it's time I make a concerted effort to consolidate reading list saving in Raindrop again.

## Reading List

Since I first began working online in 2016, I have grown and maintained quite a curatorial habit, and therefore sought all sorts of modern curator's tools. The system I settled upon for some five years: a dedicated Reading List channel in Extratone's Discord. It wasn't until this past year that I encouraged something which (so far) has exceeded willy-nilly copy-and-paste of URLs into a single feed. It's an application/bookmarking service called Raindrop which includes tagging, public, RSS-enabled collections, and fairy competent web page archiving. This is my main Reading List Raindrop feed, but there are 13 others on my Profile.

Your visitors can sort bookmarks, navigate to nested collections and filter by tags. You can change view layout, set an icon, name and description in Share settings.

All shared collections will be showed in your public profile, check out my [https://raindrop.io/exentrich](https://raindrop.io/exentrich).

The nicest part is that you can now embed your bookmarks into your website, blog or note taking app. This is how it might look like:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5600/1*cW_A7dTLyQxhi3NK9MKvzg.png)

This is just an image, but very soon you will be able to embed Raindrop.io to Medium. I’m waiting for approval

Imagine what possibilities it gives! You can put reference links (and update them on the fly) to your blog articles or showcase your inspiration/playlists/learning materials/etc on a personal website.

Learn more how to embed and customize on [this dedicated help page](https://help.raindrop.io/embed).

> In the past embedding have been also possible, but not documented. Be sure to update your URLs to a new format. You can grab a new URL from a public page by clicking Share button. Sorry for inconvenience.

As old users remember public pages not a new feature, but I worked hard to improve it significantly. Old version had a bugs, lack of features and not well optimized for mobile. New version is modern, slick, user-friendly and highly optimized for search engines.

Now bookmarks from nested collections are shown together in one big list. Usually nested collections are just a sub categories, or like a filters. So I think showing bookmarks together without splitting by each collection is an improvement in the right direction.

> If you don’t like this change just enable **Old view** for Nested collections in [settings](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/app)

Bookmarks now paginated instead of infinite scrolling. It gives a better user experience and makes UI more predictable. Visitors can easily navigate to very last or specific bookmark because they can remember exact page where it located. And obviously you can share a link to specific page.

Be sure that **format of a public page URL is changed.** Don’t worry old links **will keep working indefinitely**.

New URL format look like this [https://raindrop.io/press/movies-2199085](https://raindrop.io/press/movies-2199085)  
Note that it contains your **username**, it can be changed in [account settings](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/account). It also has a human friendly **name of a collection**, this will improve search engine ranking and makes URL more visually appealing.

When you change a name of a collection old URLs will keep working, so no need to worry about it.

-   All your bookmarks and collections are private by default. Public page is optional feature, you need to [manually enable it](https://help.raindrop.io/public-page)
-   Public profile page is only accessible if user have at least one public collection
-   You can change your username and avatar in [account settings](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/account)
