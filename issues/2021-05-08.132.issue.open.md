* [*The Tone* archives](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=7715f70b539dafc216104455f&id=f3eb733712)
* [The few issues of my Editor's Letters which I published through Mailchimp.](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=7715f70b539dafc216104455f&id=89161e3b4d)
* [My old TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/DavidBlue/archive) probably has the greatest potential to offer something appropriate to publish, here, but maybe I just haven't looked at it in far too long lol.

* [Editor's Letters | David Blue](http://web.archive.org/web/20170117171051/http://www.extratone.com/meta/freq) <- how they _originally_ looked lmao...
