These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and T Media Tech, LLC** **(“we,” “us” or “our”), concerning your access to and use of the TruthSocial.com website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). 

You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with all of these Terms of Service, then you are expressly prohibited from using the Site and you must discontinue use immediately.

Supplemental Terms of Service or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Service at any time and for any reason. 

We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Service, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. 

It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Service to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Service by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Service are posted. 

The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. 

Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. 

The Site is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Site. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms of Service prior to you using the Site.

A copy of your Notification will be sent to the person who posted or stored the material addressed in the Notification.

(5) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; 

(6) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed upon.

  2. #### Counter Notification

If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Site as a result of a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification to us using the contact information provided below (a “Counter Notification”). 

To be an effective Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification must include substantially the following:

If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled material, unless we first receive notice from the party filing the Notification informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.

Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury.

  2. Information You May Provide 

You may elect to provide a variety of information during your interactions with us and the Site, such as emails you may send us, SMS or text messages that you may sign up for and emails or newsletters that you sign up to receive from us.

Depending on the device and operating system, device-based location information may be derived from GPS and nearby wireless signals such as cell towers, Wi-Fi networks, and Bluetooth beacons. We will not collect your device-based location information unless you have permitted us to access location services on your device. You can disable this access at any time in your system settings.

C.   How We Use The Information

We may also collect other data such as the page or site that referred you to the Site, the date and time you visited the Site, and your current IP address.

Be sure to check with your web browsers on how to accept or reject third-party cookies.  

E. Sharing Information with Others 

We may share information we collect with our subsidiaries, successors or related companies for the purposes described in our respective privacy policies, and to offer, provide, and improve services and products offered both individually and jointly with these companies.  

We may share information we receive or collect, such as when you give us permission through an affirmative election (for example, clicking "yes" in response to a message or email inquiring as to whether to "share my email with this advertiser").  We may also share information if we partner with a third party to provide services on our behalf, such as credit card processors, customer support, advertising services, or bulk email processors who may send out emails on our behalf. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. They are not authorized to use your personal information for their own, unrelated purposes.

We may also share your information in order to comply with legal requests such as subpoenas or court orders or to protect or defend our legal rights or property or the legal rights of third parties, employees, agents, and contractors (including under our agreements).

Additionally, we may share information we gather from devices you use to access the Site with its third-party vendors, manufacturers, service providers or advertising entities. We share this information for a variety of purposes such as tracking advertising, estimating the number of  users, security and fraud detection, debugging problems and for providing you with more relevant advertisements on the Site.

If there is a transfer or sharing of your personal information in accordance with this policy, we will seek assurances from the recipients of such information (prior to the transfer) that they will safeguard the information in a manner consistent with this policy. 

F.  Account Management and Settings

You will have the ability to access and modify your User Registration Data on your account, which you may do through the Settings section of our Site at any time.  

You have control through Settings on your Account to limit data we collect from you and how we use it.  You can also download the information you have shared with the Site. 

Your User Registration Data will be retained by us while your account is active. We will retain and use this information for the purposes for which it was collected (as specified in this policy or as we disclose to you outside of this policy), including, to provide information and products to you, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Upon your registration of an account on the Site, you may elect to receive promotional, marketing, or other similar emails tailored to your interests. You may change this election at any time. Additionally, you may also unsubscribe from any promotional, marketing, or other similar emails you receive.  We will send you confirmation emails and other Site-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. 

G. Security Measures 

When necessary, we have implemented security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information we collect or receive from you.  Nevertheless, no security measures are impenetrable and there are always security risks. 

We will use the information we collect in ways that are relevant and compatible with the purpose for which that information was collected or provided to us as disclosed in this policy. We will use safeguards to ensure that all information collected, processed, and/or stored is protected from loss, destruction, or use in a manner inconsistent with our policies or the purpose for which we received it.

Our Site, as well as advertisements on our Site, may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit personal information to any of those websites, the privacy statements and practices of those websites govern their use of your information.  Please be sure to review the privacy statement of any website you visit.

Other third parties or advertisers may utilize framing techniques to serve content to and from webpages accessible through our Site while preserving the look and feel of our website. Please note that you may be providing your personal information to this third-party (and not to us) in this situation.

## Metadata

"Truth Social is based on Mastodon, free and open-source software that is released under the AGPLv3 license. AGPLv3 requires any derivative source code to be publicly available. Because Truth Social's terms describe its software as proprietary, Mastodon founder and lead developer Eugen Rochko has said: "that would be a problem, as that would indicate a license violation".[9] On October 22, the Software Freedom Conservancy said that Truth Social was in violation of the terms of the license, and that TMTG had 30 days to comply." - (Excerpt from Truth Social's Wikipedia Page: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Truth_Social)
