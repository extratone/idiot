# [The Psalms' Firefox Theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/psalms/)

`https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/psalms/`

A Firefox theme inspired by the style of my World Wide Web Blog, [_The Psalms_](https://bilge.world).

As such, these two resources inadvertently serve in documenting the specifics of its style:
* The blog's [Colophon](https://bilge.world)
* This [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge)
