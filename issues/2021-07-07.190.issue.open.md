![A mobile device screen displays a composite image of the GETTR social app and a smirking, shrugging Sonic the Hedgehog.](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

Sonic memes and a wide variety of other shitposts are flooding the just-launched conservative microblogging platform GETTR.Image: GETTR / Sega / Kotaku / Sean Gallup (Getty Images)

Nary a month after the [dramatic implosion](https://gizmodo.com/trump-deplatforms-himself-1847017401) of former president (and current [Twitter refugee](https://gizmodo.com/jack-offs-trump-1846023346)) Donald Trump’s [attempted blogging career](https://gizmodo.com/area-man-wants-you-to-check-out-his-blog-1846824948), the septuagenarian authoritarian’s “team” of grifting enablers has launched its latest attempt at a social network for folks who are just too darn patriotic for mainstream social media...and also for all sorts of Sonic the Hedgehog porn.

The unpleasantly named [GETTR](https://gettr.com/)—Hillary Clinton lives rent-free in that dude’s head—is essentially a Twitter clone. Its slogan, “the marketplace of ideas,” suggests that inexplicably fence-sitting centrists might find it appealing as well, and that’s particularly true if they’re into furry vore artwork and memes about Sonic the Hedgehog getting pregnant.

That keeps coming up, doesn’t it? It seems that [GETTR’s early launch](https://gizmodo.com/maga-crowd-gets-its-wish-for-a-free-speech-hellhole-pa-1847214335) (it was originally promised for Independence Day) has attracted a variety of leftist riff-raff from TikTok, weird Twitter and the like, and [they’ve embraced](https://gizmodo.com/new-social-media-site-from-team-trump-upsets-qanon-fait-1847220199) the unsavory, Trump-associated birdsite wannabe as the perfect place to share degenerate hentai, furry porn, leftist Sonic memes, and stock photos of pudgy, aged men in their underwear. 

[QAnon](https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-qanon.html) genius Jordan Sather, who [suggests drinking bleach](https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-conspiracy-theorists-magic-cure-for-coronavirus-is-drinking-lethal-bleach) to cure the ‘rona, [noted](https://gettr.com/post/pm8l) that, “Shills are already hitting the #QAnon hashtag on GETTR hard. I won’t repost what I’m finding. Titties and bad words and stuff.” 

“Stuff,” indeed. So far GETTR’s moderation safeguards haven’t stood a chance against the NSFW Communist mpreg onslaught, which has flooded venerable tags like #QAnon with the sorts of sexuality-threatening furotica that pass through MAGA uncles’ minds during Thanksgiving rants. It seems likely that a fair few decent, upstanding conspiracy theorists and proto-fascists are rapidly being forced to come to terms with the existence of a large chunk of the shitposting internet, or at least to acknowledge it outside of their secret bookmarks.

Leftist Sonic/video game memes, general hentai, and sometimes Sonic hentai has been hard to miss for would-be users of the new GETTR social app.Screenshot: GETTR / Sega / Kotaku

There are also quite a few accounts impersonating prominent conservative personalities, adding to confusion by shitposting behind a thin veneer of authenticity.Screenshot: GETTR / Sega / Kotaku

The galaxy-brain-level #sonic_came_in_my_bussy has emerged as a particularly popular hashtag. Below, Sonic shares a smooch with President Obama.Screenshot: GETTR / Sega / Kotaku

GETTR seems to support TikTok embeds, which lets users easily import whatever wacky memes they like from the super-popular microblogging vid site. [This one from the screenshot](https://www.tiktok.com/@s1lverthehedgehog/video/6966827918345407749) is very good.Screenshot: GETTR / Sega / Kotaku

Peeking in at the top there is a fake account for a rather infamous denizen of Twitter. Someone seemingly saw fit to import their history of Sonic-related tweets to GETTR. [Update 7/04 3:00 p.m. ET: Actually, it may not be a fake account, and it seems to have all of their past tweets.]Screenshot: GETTR / Sega / Kotaku

Sonic’s thoughts on tax reform lack nuance, but it’s great that he’s able to exercise his right to free speech in this wonderful land of the free, home of the brave.Screenshot: GETTR / Sega / Kotaku

Sega’s speedy meme king is particularly well represented, with tags like #sonicfeet, #sonicismygod, #soniclovescommunism, #sonicmylove, and #sonic_came_in_my_bussy (ask your father about that one) tracking the sometimes-pregnant blue blur’s presence across the nascent social network for shitheads. But despite GETTR’s professed dedication to #FREEZEPEACH, a peek into [accidentally leaked source code](https://twitter.com/adgodev/status/1410667547335217169) reveals its operators can add or remove “trending” topics at will. To arms, blue bussy brigade—you’re being censored!

It’s also quite easy to impersonate well-known conservative figures on the service, as evidenced by an account for Supreme Court justice [“Brett Kavanaugh”](https://gettr.com/user/bretkavanaugh) enthusiastically sharing fetish images of a massive Sonic treading on a hapless fursona. I’m split on whether _Hercules_ actor [Kevin Sorbo’s profile](https://gettr.com/user/kevinsorbo) is real or not. That fellow is a bit touched.

The prominence of Sonic amid the GETTR shitposting ruckus will come as no surprise to dedicated internetologists. Since his 1991 debut, Sega’s hedgehog has found a special place in fans’ hearts even as he’s acted as a gateway for an unknowable number into the realms of furrydom. His fandom’s persisted through the series’ many ups and downs, and in more recent years he’s become a key player in absurdist Twitter and TikTok memes that often bridge the gaps between the furry community, weird Twitter, overly online leftists, and places in between.

Unfortunately for GETTR and its would-be users, the torrent of furry, leftist filth shows no signs of stopping anytime soon, especially given the recent media attention. Maybe Mr. Trump, who [actually hasn’t joined](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jason-miller-sadly-begs-trump-to-join-gettr-says-wed-love-to-have-him) the fledgling service yet, will step in with his legendary negotiating skills to re-assert order and make GETTR great again. Great for something beside Sonic feet pics, I mean.

# "[Gettr, the latest pro-Trump social network, is already a mess – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/gettr-trump-social-network-hack-defaced/)"

Well, that was fast. Just days after a Twitter clone from former Trump spokesperson Jason Miller launched, the new social network is already beset by problems.

For one, hackers quickly leveraged Gettr’s API to [scrape the email addresses](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv44m/hackers-scrape-90000-gettr-user-emails-surprising-no-one) of more than 85,000 of its users. Usernames, names and birthdays were also part of the scraped data set, which was surfaced by Alon Gal, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock.

“When threat actors are able to extract sensitive information due to neglectful API implementations, the consequence is equivalent to a data breach and should be handled accordingly by the firm [and] examined by regulators,” Gal told TechCrunch.

Last week, TechCrunch’s own Zack Whittaker [predicted](https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1410669640188055566) that Gettr would soon see its data scraped through its API.

The scraped data is just one of Gettr’s headaches. The app actually went live in the App Store and Google Play last month but left beta on July 4 following a[ launch post in Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606). While the app is meant to appeal to the famously anti-China Trump sphere, [Gettr apparently received early funding](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpworld-app-is-bankrolled-by-fugitive-chinese-billionaire?ref=home) from Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, an ally of former Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported that Guo is at the center of a [massive online disinformation network](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/17/guo-wengui-disinformation-steve-bannon/) that spreads anti-vaccine claims and QAnon conspiracies.

On July 2, the app’s team apologized for signup delays citing a spike in downloads, but a bit of launch downtime is probably the least of its problems. Over the weekend, a number of official Gettr accounts, including Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Steve Bannon and Miller’s own, [were compromised](https://www.businessinsider.com/gettr-trump-allies-get-accounts-hacked-july-4-launch-day-2021-7), raising more questions about the app’s shoddy security practices.

That incident aside, fake accounts overwhelm any attempt to find verified users on Gettr. That goes for the app’s own recommendations too: a fake brand account for Steam was among the app’s own recommendations during TechCrunch’s testing.

Another red flag: The app’s design is conspicuously identical to Twitter and appears to have used the company’s API to copy some users’ follower counts and profiles. Gettr encourages new users to use their Twitter handle in the sign up process, saying that it will allow tweets to be copied over in some cases (we signed up, but this didn’t work for us). TechCrunch reached out to Twitter about Gettr’s striking similarities and the use of its API but the company declined to comment.

On mobile, Gettr is basically an exact clone of Twitter — albeit one that’s very rough around the edges. Some of Gettr’s copy is stilted and strange, including the boast that it’s a “non-bias” social network that “tried the best to provide best software quality to the users, allow anyone to express their opinion freely.”

The company is positioning itself as an alternative for anyone who believes that mainstream social networks are hostile to far right ideas. Gettr’s website beckons new users with familiar Trumpian messaging: “Don’t be Cancelled. Flex Your 1st Amendment. Celebrate Freedom.”

“Hydroxycholoroquine works!” Miller shared (Gettr’d?) over the weekend, quoting the former president. “And nobody is going to take down this post or suspend this account! #GETTR.” So far on Gettr, content moderation is either lax or nonexistent. But [as we’ve seen with Parler](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/parler-crawls-back-online-empty-and-with-a-tea-party-ceo/) and other havens for sometimes violent conspiracies, that approach can only last so long.

In spite of being widely associated with Trump through Miller and former Trump campaign staffer Tim Murtaugh, the former president doesn’t yet have a presence on the app. Some figures from Trump’s orbit have established profiles on Gettr, including Steve Bannon (84.7K followers) and Mike Pompeo (1.3M followers), but a search for Trump only brings up unofficial accounts. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/former-trump-aide-starts-social-media-platform-without-old-boss?sref=ExbtjcSG) that Trump has no plans to join the app. (Given Gettr’s [preponderance of Sonic the Hedgehog porn](https://kotaku.com/sonic-smut-is-flooding-trump-s-new-social-network-1847226591), we can’t exactly blame him.)

It’s hard to say whether the app’s technical issues or Trump’s absence will dampen interest in Gettr. According to estimates from[ Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/), Gettr has racked up roughly 1.3 million installs globally since June, with Brazil trailing the U.S. as the app’s second-biggest market.

The online pro-Trump ecosystem remains scattered in mid-2021. With Trump banned and the roiling conspiracy network around QAnon no longer welcome on Facebook and Twitter, Gettr positioned itself as a refuge for mainstream social media’s many outcasts. But given Gettr’s mounting early woes, the sketchy Twitter clone’s moment in the sun might already be coming to an end.
