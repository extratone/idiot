# "[Overamped – Replace AMP pages in Safari](https://overamped.app/press-kit)"

Overamped is currently in beta and can be [downloaded from TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wkM877U3).

Overamped is a Safari Extension that disables AMP pages in Google and Bing search results and links opened from other apps by redirecting to the canonical version.

## How it Works

The Overamped app provides a Safari Web Extension that can be enabled within Safari. It interacts with search result pages and looks for results that link to an AMP page.

Any AMP pages found in search results will be replaced with the canonical version of the linked website, exactly as they would be if you searched using a tablet or laptop.

### Integrates Well With iOS and Safari

The AMP version of a website that's been redirected by Overamped won't appear in your history and going back or forward will never load the AMP page. Any links that are supported by a native app you have installed will automatically open the native app.

### Enable AMP for Specific Websites

If you prefer the AMP version of a website the Overamped extension can be configured within Safari to allow specific websites of your choosing to still use AMP.

## Privacy

Overamped does not collect, share, or sell any of your personal data, including what you search or any pages you open. For more information [read the privacy policy](/privacy).

# [Overamped FAQ](https://overamped.app/faq)

**Does Overamped change the search results I see?**
No. The removal of AMP is done entirely on-device, and no results are ever removed, reordered, replaced, or otherwise altered in any way, other than to link to the canonical non-AMP version.

**Does Overamped impact battery life**
Yes, but it is negligible; all scripts are loaded locally and Overamped performs the minimal amount of work required to function.

**Does Overamped work on iPadOS**
Yes, but it is not necessary when using larger Safari windows; Google will not return AMP result unless the Safari window is small, e.g. in split view.
