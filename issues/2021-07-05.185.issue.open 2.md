# We want people reading more news and less noise. 

### We are bringing people and the news industry closer by facilitating thoughtful dialogue and creating more exposure for more sources. 

### We’re removing noise from the equation by creating a platform specifically intended for news and what matters. 

# What we believe 

### People need to read more news from more sources. 

We believe that a healthy news diet consists of reading news from a diverse variety of sources covering a wide range of categories. We built our platform with this in mind and made it very easy for users to follow multiple sources while also creating equal exposure for smaller organizations via the timeline. 

### A cleaner information ecosystem begins with news. 

Social media has accelerated the amount of information shared between people, however, it has also accelerated the ubiquity of misinformation and disinformation. We need to create technology that prioritizes information from credible news sources, not just content that confirms user biases. 

### An informed society is a healthier society.

We believe that sharing news more frequently and engaging with new sources leads to more informed and productive dialogue. We wanted to make the experience for getting news and sharing news extremely simple and convenient - and we believe this will help create more social cohesion.
