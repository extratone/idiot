# Brad Varol, Father of Whyp

My conversation with [Bradley Varol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradleyvarol/) - a London-based developer who loves Hardstyle, drives an imported Toyota Chaser, and has bigger aspirations for his two-month-old audio sharing service than Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio, combined.

We talked a lot about the future, but I think it'd be worth my time to thoroughly analyze Whyp's usefulness in the present, which you'll see soon on both *Extratone* and *The Psalms*. If you want to *really* go deep, you can [follow and comment on its Issue in *The Psalms*' GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/75). 

Once again, *any* thoughts of yours even remotely adjacent to the subject would make my day - do [reach out](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com)!
