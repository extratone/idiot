  * ==Access Safari Tabs by either tapping the double square icon or simply swiping up on the Tab Bar==
  * You can search Tabs at the top, press/hold + drag Tabs to rearrange them
  * Add a new Tab in the bottom left with the + icon, or tab Tabs in the bottom middle to customize Tab Groups
  * Tap a Tab or choose Done in the bottom right corner to leave the Tab view
  * Another change here is the X to close out Tabs has moved from the top left to the top right
 * To create a custom Tab Group, tap **_X Tabs_** in the bottom middle of the Tabs screen (this is also where Private browsing lives now)
  * Choose New Empty Tab Group or New Tab Group from X Tabs
  * Name your Tab Group, tap OK

### Photos
> ==Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.==
> ==While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.==

One of the major changes [arriving with iOS 15](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-features-officially-announced/) is a totally redesigned Safari. The all-new browser looks to make it easier to use with one hand as it shifts the URL/tab bar to the bottom, introduces customizable Tab Groups and new start page, and more. Let’s dive into how the new Safari in iOS 15 works.

The new Safari is coming to [iPhone, iPad](https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4), as well as Mac with [macOS Monterey](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-macos-monterey/). Apple says two of its goals with the new Safari in iOS 15 were making “controls easier to reach with one hand” and putting “content front and center.”

There’s no doubt it will take some getting used to as there’s some real muscle memory to rewrite here. Time will tell if Apple makes some changes to this during the beta period after hearing feedback.

_iOS 15 is currently [available as a public and developer beta](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/how-to-install-ios-15-beta/)_ _with the official release set for fall 2021._

  * As you swipe on a webpage, the tab bar smoothly minimizes into the bottom of the app
  * Swipe back up or tap at the bottom to make the tab bar reappear
  * Pull down from the top of many websites to reload the page

### Extensions

Another handy change coming to Safari for iOS 14/iPadOS 15 is support for extensions. We’ll likely start to see developers build early support for this over the summer and many will be ready to go for the public launch in the fall.

# Exclusive: Apple’s Craig Federighi on WWDC’s new privacy features | Fast Company

## We talk to Apple’s software chief about iCloud Private Relay and other upcoming protections—and why regulation alone won’t help consumers defend their data.

Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer’s Conference kicked off today. As with last year, the company opted to hold the event remotely due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But that didn’t stop Apple from showing off a host of new products, including iOS 15, iPadOS 15, MacOS Monterey, WatchOS 8, and the all-new iCloud Plus subscription service. Another similarity to last year’s WWDC: Many of those new products are not only packed with cool new features but also underlying privacy enhancements.

Indeed, new privacy protections have become one of the most important reasons to look forward to Apple’s annual operating-system upgrades. When it comes to our digital privacy in the third decade of the 21st century, it feels like we’re in a constant cat-and-mouse game. Whenever a technology comes along that gives us more privacy, it seems that those who want their hands on our data come up with new, creative ways to get it.

But does Apple also feel like it’s in a cat-and-mouse game? That’s the question that I put to Craig Federighi, the company’s senior vice president of software engineering, when I spoke to him about Apple’s newest privacy features in advance of today’s keynote. We also talked about the company’s new iCloud Private Relay (a “VPN killer” as some tech pundits are sure to call it), Apple’s role versus the governments in playing privacy regulator, and user uptake of the iPhone’s new App Tracking Transparency feature, which is so unpopular with a very blue social network.

“I think the analogy with security is apt,” Federighi says of the feline-and-rodent comparison. “The incentives for ‘innovation’ in the exploitation world are high, and so there is a lot of advancement in the art of tracking; a lot of advancement in the arts of security exploits. And so, in both areas, we think there’s going to continue to be a cat and mouse game. We think we bring a lot of tools to that fight, and we can largely stay ahead of it and protect our customers. But it’s something we recognize as a battle we will be fighting for years to come.”

At WWDC, Apple unveiled some massive new weapons in that war.

## iCloud Private Relay makes VPNs look nosy

One of the most surprising announcements Apple made today is its new iCloud Plus service. The service is an evolution of the company’s existing paid iCloud service, which offers increased online storage plans across multiple tiers. What iCloud Plus adds to existing iCloud subscriptions is three new privacy features: Hide My Email, which lets users share a unique random email address at will instead of giving their real one away; an expansion of HomeKit Secure Video, which allows an unlimited number of connected security cameras to store their footage on the user’s iCloud account without counting toward storage limits; and iCloud Private Relay.

This last feature is Apple’s best privacy innovation in years—and nothing short of game-changing when it comes to shielding our movements around the web. The obvious comparison people will make is that iCloud Private Relay is Apple’s version of a VPN (something I have called for in the past for the company to offer). But from an engineering perspective, Private Relay’s privacy protections make VPNs look weak.

With a traditional VPN, users’ internet traffic is encrypted and then sent to the VPN’s server, which masks the IP and routes the data on to the websites users want to access. This keeps your ISP from knowing what site you are visiting and the destination website from knowing your actual IP address. But it still leaves one gaping privacy hole: the VPN provider itself knows your real IP and the websites you’re visiting.

And the problem is, you can never be sure what a VPN is doing with your browsing data. Of course, some VPN providers are reputable and hold no logs of your internet activity. But the world is filled with free and low-cost VPN providers that you simply have to trust are not misusing your data.

We hope users believe in Apple as a trustworthy intermediary, but we didn’t even want you to have to trust us.”

This is where iCloud Private Relay comes in—and puts VPNs to shame. iCloud Private Relay uses a dual-hop architecture. When you navigate to a website through Safari, iCloud Private Relay takes your IP address, which it needs to connect you to the website you want to go to, and the URL of that site. But it encrypts the URL so not even Apple can see what website you are visiting. Your IP and encrypted destination URL then travels to an intermediary relay station run by a third-party trusted partner. Apple would not name these trusted partners, but says the company is working with some of the largest content providers out there. Before getting to this relay station, however, your IP address is anonymized and randomized, so the relay partner can’t identify you or your device. Then at the relay station, the destination URL is unencrypted, so the third-party provider can send you on to the website you want to go to.
Because of this dual-hop architecture, neither Apple nor the relay station knows both who you are and where you are going. Apple knows who you are (because you are using iCloud Private Relay), but it doesn’t know where you’re browsing. Its third-party partner knows where you are browsing–but not who you are.

Why did Apple develop this technology rather than build a more conventional VPN into its operating systems?  “Core to the nature of the internet is that the IP address is traditionally exposed between the requester and the host – and that has some privacy knock on effects that aren’t always understandable to users and certainly aren’t always desirable to users. And so that’s a problem we wanted to solve,” says Federighi. He notes an unprotected IP has led to vectors for abuse by bad actors. “VPNs are a technology that has sought to provide some of those protections, but they do involve putting a lot of trust in a single centralized entity: the VPN provider. And that’s a lot of responsibility for that intermediary, and involves the user making a really difficult trust decision about exposing all of that information to a single entity.”

Federighi notes most internet users aren’t in a position to gauge the trustworthiness of any particular VPN. “We wanted to take that [trust evaluation] completely out of the equation by having a dual-hop architecture,” he says. “We hope users believe in Apple as a trustworthy intermediary, but we didn’t even want you to have to trust us [because] we don’t have this ability to simultaneously source your IP and the destination where you’re going to–and that’s unlike VPNs. And so we wanted to provide many of the benefits that people are seeking when in the past they’ve decided to use a VPN, but not force that difficult and conceivably perilous privacy trade-off in terms of trusting it a single intermediary.”

If all goes according to Apple’s plans, iCloud Private Relay will also have the “it just works” benefit of the company’s best technologies. When users are logged into their iCloud Plus account on a Mac, iPhone, or iPad, the feature will be automatically enabled. It should be noted, however, that, unlike a VPN, iCloud Private Relay will only work in Safari. That’s a bummer for anyone who uses another browser such as Chrome or Firefox (and a possible argument for switching to Safari).

Using iCloud Private Relay, a website will get users’ regional area but not their precise location. This way, users can still enjoy localized content on the sites they visit while hiding their specific whereabouts. Unlike traditional VPNs, Private Relay won’t allow users to route their traffic through a server in a particular country, a common technique for sidestepping the geolocation locks that Netflix and other streaming services use to restrict access to content by region.

Users of corporate VPNs should encounter no problems running both their company’s VPN and iCloud Private Relay at the same time. That’s because the corporate traffic will route through the corporate VPN, while all other traffic will route through iCloud Private Relay. And users can still use third-party VPNs even when iCloud Private Relay is enabled. In this case, all traffic will route through the third-party VPN, which means users who use those VPNs to get around streaming services’ geo-restrictions will not have to disable Private Relay to do so.

## From email to Siri

iCloud Private Relay was far from the only privacy enhancement Apple unveiled today. And while Private Relay is part of Apple’s new for-pay iCloud Plus subscription service, other new privacy features are baked into iOS 15, iPadOS 15, WatchOS 8, and MacOS Monterey at no extra cost.

These privacy enhancements include Mail Privacy Protection, a devastating blow to the tracking pixel industry. Tracking pixels are shady, invisible pixels that marketers (or anyone who wants to) slip into an email sent to you. When you open that email, the tracking pixel connects to the sender’s server, alerting the sender to things like your IP address, your location, and the fact that you’ve opened the email at all.

But with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and MacOS Monterey, if you use Apple’s Mail app, any email you open will now route through a relay that loads any tracking pixels there before sending the email onto you. Since tracking pixels are remotely loaded on Apple’s relay they aren’t associated with your IP address, thus preventing the sender from using them as a tool to spy on you. The advantage here is that the email you receive can still load all the rich remote imagery—which itself can be used used as tracking pixels—without giving away your privacy. You’ll get this protection no matter which email service you use via the Mail app, such as iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or a work account.
Apple is also beefing up Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention for Macs and iOS devices. Now ITP will block a user’s IP address from being revealed for known trackers. It already blocked fingerprinting characteristics such as screen resolution, apps and extensions installed, and other details that websites can use to determine your identity.

Apple’s non-Mac devices will get even more privacy transparency features this year, too. iOS, iPadOS, and WatchOS will gain App Privacy Report, which lets users easily see how often an app accesses services the user has granted use of such as the device’s microphone and camera,  its photos or contacts, or other information such as Health data. The report, which can be found in the Privacy section in the Settings app, will also allow users to see what third-party domains an app is contacting. These third-party domains hint at where an app could be sending your data. If you don’t like what you see, you can take action by changing the offending app’s permissions in Settings.

Siri, too, is becoming much more private. In recent years, virtually every voice assistant (Amazon’s Alexa, the Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and yes, Siri) has made headlines for sending some users’ voice recordings to be verified by a human. To make sure this can’t happen again, Siri will now process audio requests on the device itself. That means there are no more recordings to be sent off to a human anywhere. As a matter of fact, in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, many Siri operations—including launching apps, setting alarms and timers, and controlling music—can be performed with no internet connection at all.

## Choice, not disruption

Some of this year’s privacy and transparency enhancements are sure to ruffle feathers. After all, ISPs won’t be happy to learn that iCloud Private Relay will make it easy for Apple device users to keep their very monetizable browsing activity private–users who might not have turned to expensive or confusing VPN services in the past.

And some other tech giants might not like that Apple’s new App Privacy Report lets users see where, for instance, a big social media app is sending their data. Some companies could push back as hard against these privacy enhancements as they did against Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature earlier this year. That feature lets Apple’s users choose to allow an app to share their data with third parties. By some accounts, it’s led to almost 95% of iPhone users opting out of app tracking.

We … view success not through the lens of what the opt in or opt out rate is, but the fact that users have choice.”

Given how high this opt out rate is reported to be, I asked Federighi if he can confirm these figures. Federighi declined to do so, saying Apple doesn’t have official numbers. However, he says that when Apple designed ATT, it wasn’t necessarily hoping that most users would opt out of tracking. Nor was it hoping to kneecap those in the advertising business.
“The key for us is that users have a choice,” he explains. “You know, whether if it was 50/50 or 95/5 or 5/95– that’s all fine if it represents what the user actually wanted; that they had the opportunity to evaluate that decision and make whatever decision was right for them. So we certainly view success not through the lens of what the opt in or opt out rate is, but the fact that users have choice.”

Speaking of consumer choice, many companies–or even entire industries–are reluctant to offer it because doing so hurts their bottom line. That’s why government regulations are often necessary to get powerful businesses to change their ways. But in the privacy area, most national governments have found themselves unwilling to regulate. A recent Guardian op-ed by Open University professor John Naughton lamented this fact, noting that Apple seems to be the only organization capable of defending our privacy.

I asked Federighi if he feels that Apple must pick up the ball because governments haven’t enacted laws that would guarantee privacy. “I’d certainly like to believe that we’re doing good and play a constructive role here, for sure,” he says. “[But] I do think Apple has a set of different tools, naturally, than governments have. We have certain technology skills and a certain access to an end-to-end technology platform where we can innovate.”

Federighi explains that governments are often reactive when it comes to technology–and there’s no way for them to get around that. At least on the consumer front, companies do most of the innovating. They’re also the ones who find new ways to exploit data. So governments can put rules around technologies or processes only after they’ve become a problem. Those rules often lag far behind the speed of such innovations. That’s why even if governments were more proactive, it would still fall on companies such as Apple to develop new privacy-enhancing technologies.

That being said, Federighi believes that “there’s absolutely a role where government can look at what companies like Apple are doing and say, ‘You know, that thing is such a universal good–such an important recognition of customer rights–and Apple has proven it’s possible. So maybe it should be something that becomes a more of a requirement.’ But that may tend to lag [Apple’s privacy] innovation and creation of some new thing that they can evaluate and decide to make essentially the law.”

History has shown that we can move the industry in really meaningful ways.”

To date, Apple’s privacy advancements haven’t had that trickle-down effect on government regulation. But they’re already affecting the broader tech industry. For example, Google is introducing a somewhat watered-down version of Apple’s Privacy Labels in Android’s Google Play store, though not until 2022. Android 12, due later this year, will also feature equivalents of  iOS privacy enchantments such as approximate location permissions and camera and mic indicator lights. Better late than never? Sure. But they might not be in the works at all if Apple hadn’t introduced such privacy enhancements first.
I asked Federighi if he’s optimistic Apple’s continued privacy advancements will keep the broader tech industry moving in the right direction as far as user privacy is concerned.

“I think history has shown that we can move the industry in really meaningful ways. And certainly sometimes others come along slowly or reluctantly. But ultimately, when customers become aware of what they should expect, what they can expect, what is possible once they are made aware that the deal they thought they had to make–that actually, that’s not a deal they have to make— then the whole industry has to react to offer customers what they now realize they want and demand,” he says. “As we continue to–hopefully, in many areas–show the way, I think we will change customer expectations and the market as a whole will react. And that’s a really important role we play.”

iCloud Private Relay and the other privacy features of iCloud Plus will be available to current and new iCloud storage plan subscribers for the same cost as the older plans when iCloud Plus debuts this fall. All other iOS 15, iPadOS 15, WatchOS 8, and MacOS Monterey privacy features will arrive when those operating systems get their updates, also in the fall.

This morning at Apple’s second fully-remote WWDC keynote address, Craig Federighi introduced iOS and iPadOS 15. This year’s updates include significant improvements to core first-party apps, new controls for maintaining focus, system-wide text and object recognition in images, and much more.

On the iPad-only side of things, Apple has announced a variety of new multitasking interface elements, feature parity with the iPhone’s Home Screen, quick note capturing available at any time in any app, and an overhauled Swift Playgrounds which supports building and shipping complete SwiftUI apps to the App Store.

As usual, developer betas are available today, with final versions scheduled to ship to all users this fall. Let’s take a look at all the details that Apple has in store for us this year.

## FaceTime

Last year the pandemic caused an explosion in video chatting, and it was quickly made clear that FaceTime did not support the features that users needed. Apple must have recognized this as well, because iOS and iPadOS 15 are patching many of these holes, and should make FaceTime a viable alternative to the now-ubiquitous Zoom for many more situations.

FaceTime in iOS 15 is finally receiving a proper grid mode in calls with multiple participants. The previous automatically-moving layout, which still exists, felt like it didn’t work well when calls had more than a few participants. Grid mode should improve upon that feeling. FaceTime will also support Apple’s Portrait mode, allowing you to blur your background while keeping yourself in focus.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple-iphone12pro-ios15-facetime-portraitmode-060721-1623120684084.jpg)

Most importantly for users familiar with Zoom, FaceTime in iOS and iPadOS 15 will allow users to generate web links for scheduled FaceTime calls. Send out the links and all invitees can use them to join the call together at the specified time. This even works for Android and Windows users, because Apple is making FaceTime available from a web browser for the first time ever. Web-based FaceTime calls remain end-to-end encrypted.

iOS 15 will also bring Apple’s Spatial Audio to FaceTime calls, allowing you to hear voices of participants like they’re coming from a direction relative to their position on your screen. There is a new Voice Isolation feature too, which can block out surrounding background noise and amplify just the sound of your voice. If you’re looking for the opposite effect, switch to Wide Spectrum mode to boost the music or other sounds around you so that your friends can hear what you’re hearing.

Finally, the new FaceTime is introducing a feature called SharePlay. This enables users to expand their video chats with movies, TV shows, music, and screen sharing. Just switch to a participating video app and press play to stream the video to everyone on your call. Playback controls are available to all participants, and play state is synced so that everyone can be confident that they’re watching the same moment together.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/shareplay-1623120646267.png)

Music (via Apple Music only) and screen sharing work the same way, although music adds a shared queue which all participants can add songs to over time. Since FaceTime supports picture-in-picture, participants can keep using their devices while they watch the video stream in a floating window. The picture-in-picture panel can be tapped at any time to reveal playback controls.

You can pass SharePlay streams off to your Apple TV to watch video content there if you’d prefer. While third-party apps will need to add support for SharePlay, Apple has provided a new API to make adoption easy. Big-name video services including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, Twitch, TikTok, ESPN+, and more have already committed to supporting the feature.

## Messages

iOS 15’s changes to the Messages app revolve mostly around sharing content. Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.

A more in-depth new feature is called Shared with You. This stretches across the system in iOS 15, allowing users to share various types of content with each other and have it show up in its associated app. For instance, if you share a song from Apple Music to one of your friends in the Messages app, when that friend opens Music on their device they’ll see the song that you sent in a new ‘Shared with You’ section. This section will include a button allowing your friend to respond directly to your Messages thread once they’ve listened to the song.

The updated Messages app will let you “pin” content, which elevates it into your own Shared with You sections and also exposes it more easily in Spotlight searched.

Shared with You works in News, Photos, Safari, Podcasts, and the TV app. We’ll need to get our hands on iOS 15 to properly explore the intricacies of this feature, but it seems quite extensive and embedded throughout the operating system.

iOS 15 also includes improvements to Memoji, such as choosing outfits, customizing headwear with multiple colors, and new accessibility customizations like cochlear implants and oxygen tubes.

## Focus

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/focus-1623122175832.png)

With iOS 15, Apple is introducing new controls to manage notifications and interruptions, and to generally help you stay more focused on whatever task is at hand throughout each day. The marquee feature here is named ‘Focus,’ and it grants users the ability to create custom modes which correspond to a set of rules. For instance, you might create a Focus named ‘Work’ which triggers Do Not Disturb to be on, but still allows notifications to come in from a selection of work-related apps. Maybe you need Slack notifications, but don’t want to hear anything from Messages until you’re finished working.

Focus can set a status message for you which shows up when friends or family try to send you messages. This lets your contacts know when you’re busy, but also allows them to override your notification settings and send a message that bypasses Do Not Disturb if they have something urgent that needs to get through to you.

Focus modes can also include Home Screen customizations, so when you switch to your Work focus you’ll only see work-related apps and widgets on your Home Screen. You can set up these Focus modes to trigger based on your location too, in which case you’ll get a notification when you arrive somewhere which you can tap to enable the corresponding Focus.

You can easily switch your current Focus via Control Center:

## Notifications

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/notifications-1623122173818.png)

Apple has slightly refreshed the design of Notifications in iOS 15. The app icons which each notification belongs to have been enlarged, and now sit to the left side of the notification content. Shifting the app icon position and removing the app name allowed each notification to get a bit shorter, so you can see more of them on a single page. For Messages notifications, you’ll now see the contact photos for whoever sent the message displayed on the notification. If you don’t want to hear from an app for a while, you’ll be able to mute specific apps so that they can’t send you notifications for the next hour, or for the rest of the day.

The new notification summary feature delays the delivery of less important notifications. Instead of delivering immediately, they get packaged up and sent to you together in a summary block. You can choose what time of day you want to receive your notification summaries, and Apple will sort the included notifications by priority as determined by on-device machine learning. Apple says that “urgent” messages will always be delivered immediately, but it’s not yet clear how this urgency is determined. During the keynote it was mentioned that messages directly from people (presumably texts, emails, maybe Slack or Discord notifications?) will never be included in the notification summary, but we’ll have to dig into the betas to see how granular the controls are around this feature.

## Live Text

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/text-1623122176879.png)

Live Text is a new system-wide feature in iOS 15 which allows you to access text recognized within images. We’ve seen earlier iterations of this idea in the past with text recognition in Notes, but now Apple is expanding it to a more ambitious level.

The most obviously impressive aspect of Live Text is in the Camera app. You can now point your camera at any text in the real world and your iPhone or iPad running iOS or iPadOS 15 will automatically recognize and parse it. You can then tap on an icon that appears in the bottom corner and the text will jump out of the image and allow you to copy it, select within it, or drag and drop it into another app on your device. This works great paired with cross-app drag-and-drop (which is making its debut on iPhone in iOS 15).

Live Text also works in the Photos app on existing images, so you can pull the text out later if you don’t want to do it while you’re in the middle of taking a picture. Data Detectors are at work here too, so if the text you’re tapping is a phone number, address, or other recognized item, you’ll be able to automatically call it, open it in Maps, etc.

Live Text doesn’t stop at text though. Using machine learning, its sister feature Visual Look Up can recognize objects such as dog breeds, flowers, landmarks, and more. Tapping on recognized objects will bring up more detailed information about them, and allow you to perform web searches to learn even more.

Live Text and Visual Look Up seem to be the (significantly improved) successors to the smart search feature that has been present in the Photos app for a few years. All of the keywords from Photos search can now be used in Spotlight to run system-wide searches for metadata recognized by Live Text or Visual Look Up.

Live Text supports seven different languages at launch, and will work on all Apple devices running the latest operating systems once they launch later this year.

## Photos

The Photos app has expanded its Memories feature even further. Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.

While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.

If you don’t want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinks you’ll like which would also fit the vibe of your video.

## Wallet

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/wallet-1623122173299.png)

Apple is continuing its quest to make the Wallet app replace all need for a physical wallet or keys. In iOS 15, they’re adding virtual keys for physical locks. This will allow users to lock and unlock their homes, apartments, offices, and hotel rooms using their iPhone.

On top of the above, Apple is working with states in the US to include drivers licenses and other official identification types in the Wallet app. They’re also working with [TSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration) to support identification via the Wallet app at airport security checkpoints.

Finally, car keys in the Wallet app are adding support for Ultra Wideband technology, allowing users to unlock and start their vehicles without removing their phones from their pockets.

All of these new features in Wallet will be rolling out with select partners (and only in the United State for some), so it will probably be years before the majority of iPhone users have access to this technology in their homes, offices, cars, and hotel rooms. While that fact puts a bit of a damper on the excitement here, it’s still great to see Apple building out Wallet with such enthusiasm. The ball is rolling now, albeit slowly, so eventually the dream of a wallet-less and key-less life is going to become a reality.

## Weather

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/weather-1623121317050.png)

Last year Apple [acquired Dark Sky](https://www.macstories.net/news/dark-sky-has-been-acquired-by-apple-and-its-api-will-be-discontinued-at-the-end-of-2021/), one of the best weather apps around. It’s still not clear how much of that technology has been integrated into iOS at this time, but iOS 15 is launching a refreshed Weather app with some advanced features similar to what Dark Sky offered.

The new Weather app will support more granular weather animations based on conditions of the location that you’re viewing. Apple is boasting that it has thousands of background animation variations to match every type of whether, and these backgrounds will adjust as weather conditions change.

On top of the new backgrounds, Weather in iOS 15 is adding high-resolution weather maps which you can view to see detailed weather conditions across large areas of land. There will also be new notifications available to warn you of impending snow, rain, or other conditions.

## Maps

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/maps-1623121317220.png)

Maps is launching an all-new experience for cities in iOS 15. This will include extraordinarily increased levels of detail, such as individual lanes rendered with dotted or solid lines to indicate passing lanes, crosswalks and bike lanes, trees, elevation levels, and high-quality 3D landmarks. A new nighttime mode will render everything as though the illumination is coming from street lights instead of the sun.

As you approach complicated interchanges, Maps will render them in 3D so that you can see at which points you need to go underneath overpasses or exit onto a particular offshoot of a multi-lane highway. These features are launching on iOS and iPadOS only, but will be coming to CarPlay later this year.

New features for transit riders include pinning favorite routes, and notifications to indicate when it’s time to disembark. In the new advanced city interface, you’ll be able to scan the buildings around yourself using your iPhone or iPad to get an augmented reality view with floating arrows to show what direction you need to walk. These highly advanced city views will only be available in a handful of select cities to start.

The final new addition to Maps is an interactive globe interface, reminiscent of Google Earth. You can pan and zoom in this interface to see detailed maps data for mountain ranges, oceans, rain forests, and more.

## Safari

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_ipadpro-ipados15-safari-safariextensions_060721-1623122431356.jpg)

Safari’s design has been refreshed to move the navigation bar to the bottom so that it’s more easily accessible using only your thumb. This new bar floats above your content, and disappears when you scroll. You can swipe side-to-side on the bar to switch between Safari tabs, or swipe up on it to access to the redesigned tab view.

The new Tab Groups feature lets you sort tabs into saved groups, then access them on any of your devices. Safari on iOS and iPadOS 15 have a redesigned start page which features favorites, reading list items, Shared with You links, and Tab Groups.

Finally, the new Safari adds support for web extensions for the first time on iOS and iPadOS. These extensions use the same code as those on macOS, so transitioning Mac extensions to iOS and iPadOS should be fairly straightforward for most developers.

# iPadOS 15

## Home Screen

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_ipadpro-ipados15-springboard-widgets_060721-1623120253036.jpg)

iPadOS 15 brings the same features to the Home Screen that we saw on the iPhone last year: widgets and the App Library. There’s nothing too special here, but a few minor changes can be seen. On iPadOS, widgets include a new size which is even bigger than the max size available on iPhone. The App Library is accessible from an icon in the iPadOS Dock rather than by swiping all the way past the leftmost Home Screen page.

## Multitasking

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-06-07-at-8-28-11-pm-1-1623122904450.png)

Multitasking is getting another refresh in iOS 15, starting with the brand new multitasking icon that sits in the top-center of each app in the status bar. Tap this icon to open the new multitasking menu, which shows a few icons that you can tap to switch the app between full screen, Slide Over, and Split View modes.

When you select Split View from the multitasking menu, and you aren’t already in Split View, your app will slide completely off the edge of the screen and reveal your Home Screen. This allows you to select a second app which you want to pair with the current one in order to create the dual Split View. Once you’ve tapped another app, the first one slides back in so that you can see them both together.

In some cases you might want to bring full-screen focus onto a particular element even when working in Split View. iPadOS 15 supports this use case. For instance, if you’re working in Split View between Mail and another app, but want to take some time to read through an email without distraction, you can tap and hold on that email. This will trigger the new ‘center window’ view, in which the email pops out of Mail and is displayed as a modal window on top of both of your Split View apps. The background apps will get a dark overlay so that you can focus in on the modal. When you’re done, dismiss the modal and you’ll be back in your previous Split View.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-06-07-at-8-29-22-pm-1623122971945.png)

To a certain editor-in-chief’s [surprise](https://www.relay.fm/connected/347) and [delight](https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1401958076543115267), Apple added a shelf to iPadOS 15. This new interface is used to display all open windows for a particular app so that you can quickly switch between them. The shelf shows up automatically at the bottom when you switch to an app that has multiple windows active. If the app only has one window, the shelf won’t exist until you create a second one. When viewing the shelf you can tap to switch between windows, swipe up on windows to close them, or use the ‘New Window’ button to create a new one.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-06-07-at-8-24-33-pm-1623122764253.png)

Another nice new addition to multitasking in iPadOS 15 is the ability to create new Split View app groups directly within the App Switcher. Just open the App Switcher and drag one app on top of another one to create a new Split View, then tap to open it.

When you have a Split View active, you’ll see the multitasking menu icons in the top center of both app windows. You can tap either of these icons to access the multitasking menu for that window, or swipe down from one of the icons to remove its app from the Split View.

Keyboard shortcuts are available for all of the new multitasking commands, and these join a [host of other new keyboard shortcuts](https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402004751689134088) to access system-level tasks across iPadOS 15.

## Notes

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_ipadpro-ipados15-notes-activitystream-mentions-tags_060721-1623122430975.jpg)

The Notes app in iOS and iPadOS 15 supports mentioning other people in shared notes, and tagging notes via the common hashtag method (type a hashtag anywhere in the note to add that tag). A new activity view tracks changes to a note over time.

On iPadOS 15, there’s an all-new system-wide feature called Quick Note, which brings up a miniature Notes interface and allows you to rapidly jot down a note and save it without leaving your current context. If you create a Quick Note from certain apps, such as Safari or Mail, you can easily [capture a back link](https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402007203435909121) to the particular mail message or webpage to keep reference of it in the note.

You can also highlight and capture text from a webpage into a Quick Note. Next time you visit the webpage, a Quick Note thumbnail will show up so you know that you have notes here. You can then open the note and tap on any text that you saved and Safari will automatically navigate the webpage to that text. This is a great way to pick up where you left off when taking notes on long articles.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_ipadpro-ipados15-quicknote-safari_060721-1623122430971.jpg)

Quick Notes can be created on iPadOS 15 via Control Center, via a new Globe Key-Q keyboard shortcut, or by dragging diagonally out from the bottom-right corner of the screen using your Apple Pencil. Each Quick Note is saved into a special folder in the Notes app, from which you can find them on your iPhone and Mac as well.

## Translate on iPad

The Translate app has come to iPad in iPadOS 15, and features improvements including Auto Translate and handwriting practice for various languages. Auto Translate recognizes languages automatically and translates text on the fly, allowing you to have a smooth conversation with someone using two languages, with the iPad translating each of your speech into text for the other to read.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/translate-1623120385090.png)

Translation is also now a system-wide feature, allowing you to select and translate text in any app. You can use the Translate app in Split View to get easy translations right next to text documents. System-wide translation and Auto Translate in the Translate app are both available on iOS 15 as well, and you can download languages to enable on-device translations.

## Swift Playgrounds

Swift Playgrounds has received an enormous upgrade in iPadOS 15. Apple still isn’t changing the name to Xcode, but Playgrounds can now be used to create fully functioning apps for iOS and iPadOS using SwiftUI.

The new Swift Playgrounds can run live previews of apps as you build them, and includes helpful tools to teach you how to write apps in SwiftUI as you go. Once you’re finished with your new app, you can submit it to the App Store directly from Swift Playgrounds.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_ipadpro-ipados15-swiftui-code-completion_060721-1623122431315.jpg)

The update also includes improved code completion for Swift, helping developers move even faster.

Building and shipping apps is a groundbreaking addition to iPadOS, although we’ll have to wait to hear from developers to see exactly how restricting the new environment feels for professional development. Regardless, it’s exciting to see the capability of developing apps come to the iPad. Even if things end up being too restricted this year, now that the feature exists Apple is sure to make it more powerful in the years to come.

## Miscellany

  * Siri requests can now occur on-device for select queries, significantly increasing the speed and privacy of Siri responses, and allowing requests to be processed with no Internet connection.
  * You can now ask Siri to share the current item on your screen, which works automatically for photos, webpages, news, and more. If the item isn’t shareable, Siri will capture a screenshot and share that instead.
  * Spotlight Search has been updated with expanded information cards for contacts, as well as for actors, TV shows, Movies, and more.
  * The iPhone setup process has been improved, including allowing existing users to back up to iCloud for free regardless of their subscription level so that they can seamlessly restore their new phone via iCloud. These temporary iCloud backups will be stored for three weeks.
  * The text magnification loupe is back for improved text selection.
  * You can now enable separation notifications which are sent when you leave behind items that are tracked with Find My.
  * Apple’s built-in password manager now supports two-factor authentication codes.
  * Custom [smart lists in Reminders](https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402012467606216706).

  * When your iPhone is powered off, it can now still be located via the Find My network. This intriguing feature definitely requires some further investigation, so we’ll have more information on how it works as the summer progresses.
  * An [improved date and time picker](https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1402013189425008648) brings back the old spinning-wheel interface when you tap into the time, but preserves the advancements from last year (including the ability to type in dates and times if you prefer that).
  * Android users moving to iOS can now access a “Move to iOS” feature which will help them transfer their photo albums, files, folders, and accessibility settings to their new iPhone.
  * A new option in Settings allows users to choose to stay on a previous version of iOS or iPadOS and just receive security updates, opting them out of the nagging notifications to upgrade to the next OS if they aren’t ready to do so.
  * New first-party widgets for Find My, Game Center, App Store Today, Sleep, Mail, and People.
  * Follow family and friends’ locations more granularly with continuous streaming updates in the Find My app.
  * New accessibility features include expanded VoiceOver details, per-app display and text size settings, and background sounds to help minimize distractions.
  * The Made for iPhone program now supports bidirectional hearing aids.
  * Headphone Accommodations can now import and parse audiograms to show and adjust for the results of hearing tests.
  * Developers can now offer subscription management and refunds within their own apps via new APIs, rather than users having to go through the Settings app or contact Apple.

## Conclusion

iOS and iPadOS 15 are both significant updates to two of Apple’s flagship operating systems. The new multitasking changes in iPadOS look like promising improvements to a system that was fairly confusing to handle in its previous iteration. FaceTime’s play to gain ground back against Zoom seems helpful to Apple users, although it remains to be seen how effective the browser-based versions will feel. Focus, Live Text, and Quick Note are all very clear wins, and I’m excited to get my hands on them as the beta season progresses.

These updates are full of such a variety of new features that it’s going to take some time to fully digest them all. As usual, the MacStories team will be digging into all of them and more over the summer, so stay tuned for our continued coverage.

iOS and iPadOS 15 are both available as developer betas today, and will be shipping to all users this fall.

# Share onscreen content with Safari

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/125917845-8067cfa3-11b1-428e-9aca-5e7b5b97f2cf.png)

> One of the many Siri updates this year includes the ability to share onscreen content with people by simply saying 'Share this with [person name]'. I'm fascinated by this feature since, as I originally suspected, it's yet another functionality that piggybacks on the NSUserActivity API, which we know Apple loves to use for all kinds of deep-linking on iOS. If you ask Siri to share content displayed onscreen while using an app that donates deep links to the system, Siri will prepare a message containing the link and confirm you want to send the message. You can test this out when reading an article in Safari, and Siri will turn the "this" into a link you can send to someone. Interestingly, if the app you're using while invoking Siri doesn't support deep-linking, a screenshot will be taken as a fallback method instead. So if you want to share an Instagram DM (we've all done this) or something you wrote in Notes with a friend, say "Share this..." to Siri, which will capture a screenshot of what's onscreen for you and offer to send it as an image. Pretty neat.

# Shared With You

# Everything New in the iOS 15 Messages App: Shared With You, Photo Collages, Memoji Updates and More
 Jul 9, 2021 at 15:52

Apple's [FaceTime](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/) app was the main focus for many of the [iOS 15](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/) updates that were introduced, but the Messages app wasn't entirely forgotten. Apple introduced a new Shared with You feature and streamlined several interface elements to make the Messages experience more pleasant.

This guide outlines all of the new features that Apple added to the Messages app in ‌iOS 15‌ and [iPadOS 15](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/).

## Shared with You

The main new feature in the ‌iOS 15‌ Messages app is Shared with You, which aggregates content that people share with you in Messages into the proper apps. So if someone sends a photo, it shows up in a Shared with You section in the [Photos](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/) app.
 
This isn't strictly a Messages addition because it's actually other apps that have this new section, but it does make Messages content much more accessible and less likely to be forgotten. There are multiple Shared with You integrations, as outlined below.

  * **Photos** \- When someone sends you a photo in Messages, it automatically appears in the Shared with You section of the ‌Photos‌ app, which is located in "For You." Tapping on an image lets you save it to the photo library, and it has a record of who sent it. If you tap on the name of the person that sent it, it automatically opens up the Messages app so you can have a conversation.
  * **Safari** \- Any link sent to you in Safari is stored in the Shared with You section of the main start page that's opened when you open up a new tab. Safari shows a preview of the link so you can see what it's about, and tapping the link opens up the website.
  * **Apple News** \- A link to an [Apple News](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/) story that's sent to you will be stored in the Shared with You section that's located in the Today and Following tabs in ‌Apple News‌. Stories that are found in News and Safari show up in Shared with You in both apps.
  * **Apple Music** \- Music links sent in Messages are shown in the Shared with You section of [Apple Music](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/), which is located under Listen Now.
  * **Apple Podcasts** \- If you're sent an episode of a Podcast or a link to a show, it's listed in the Shared with You section of Listen Now in the [Apple Podcasts](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/) app.
  * **Apple TV App** \- When a friend sends a movie or a TV show link over Messages, the TV show or movie will appear in the Shared with You section of Watch Now so you can find it quickly.

### Shared With You - Continue Conversations

In all apps that have a Shared with You section, content in these sections makes it clear who sent it to you. There are name labels that you can tap to go right to the Messages app so you can have a conversation about what was shared. Tapping the name label on an item shared with you also opens right up to the associated message so you can see the original conversation.

### Shared With You - Pinning Content

If someone shares something with you that you definitely don't want to forget about, such as a photo or a link, you can long press on it and choose the "Pin" option. Pinned items are shown first in Shared with You, in Messages search, and the Details view of a Messages conversation.

* [iOS 15: How to See All the Photos People Have Shared With You in Messages](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/see-photos-shared-with-you-messages-ios/)

## Photo Collages

Multiple images sent in the Messages app now show up as a little photo collage of images stacked on top of one another. You can tap the collage and swipe through it to see each image in the stack. At the top left of the full screen interface, you can tap to see all of the images in a grid view, and there are also quick access tools for replying, adding a tapback response, downloading an image, or sharing it.

## Improved Photo Saving

All images you're sent in the Messages app have a little download icon next to them that can be tapped to save them, which makes it much easier to save a photo that you're sent to the photo library on your device.

## Updated Photos Image Picker

The ‌Photos‌ image picker, including in the Messages app, now allows you to select photos in a specific order for sharing.

## International Updates

Apple added a few country specific features to address issues with spam. In Brazil, on-device intelligence filters out unwanted SMS messages and organizes them into Promotional, Transactional, and Junk folders to keep clutter out of the main Messages inbox.

In India and China, there are options to turn notifications on or off for unknown senders, transactions, and promotions so users have more control over which types of messages are able to send notifications.

## New Memoji and Memoji Stickers

Memoji, which are used in the Messages and ‌FaceTime‌ app, have been updated in ‌iOS 15‌ with 40 new outfit choices, an option to choose two different eye colors, new glasses options, new headwear options, and new accessibility options that include cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmet.

  
Apple has also added nine new Memoji stickers like hand wave and lightbulb moment, heart hands, and more.

## Other Messages Tweaks

  * **Group Message Access in FaceTime** \- In ‌FaceTime‌, there's an option to access a group Messages thread with the people you're chatting with.
  * **Focus Message Status** \- If you have Focus mode on and someone tries to send you an iMessage, they'll see a status update letting them know that you're in Focus mode. Friends and family can break through the Focus mode message with an urgent message.
  * **Messages Photo Search** \- If you do a search with a contact name included, you can use Spotlight to find photos that person has sent you.

# "[How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15](https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey)"

One of the most powerful new features in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, is Focus mode. 

At its core, a Focus mode is a more customizable version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb and is accessed from the same menu on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. But Focus modes are far more customizable, allowing for more granular triggers for when you’re filtering out notifications.

  * To set up a Focus, head over to “Settings” > “Focus” and hit the plus button to add a new Focus. You’ll also be able to see existing Focus modes that you’ve set up and edit them. 
  * Apple offers a variety of preset Focus modes to start with, including Personal, Work, Fitness, Gaming, Reading, and more. You’re not limited to Apple’s preset suggestions, though some of the presets — like the Driving, Fitness, or Gaming ones — offer additional features and triggers that aren’t available to user-created ones. Apple’s Fitness Focus mode, for example, can be automatically triggered when you start a Fitness Plus workout on your Apple Watch, while the Gaming mode can turn on whenever you connect a Bluetooth controller. 
  * You can create a custom Focus by selecting Custom, which will let you select a name, icon, and color for that specific focus.

  * Next, you’ll be asked to choose which of your contacts (if any) you’d like to be able to message you when that Focus mode is activated — similar to how Do Not Disturb works. 
  * The following screen will ask you to select which apps (if any) you want to allow to send notifications when that Focus is active. For example, if you’re making a “Work” Focus, you might only want your email and Slack apps to be able to send you pings.
  * Lastly, Apple will ask if you’d like to be able to receive special “Time Sensitive Notifications” — a new category of extra-important notifications that apps will be able to send that might not be able to wait until later. 

![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivvPVPgaJynGPnCx8wqsF6wz7BI=/0x0:1170x2532/1200x0/filters:focal\(0x0:1170x2532\):no_upscale\(\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722626/IMG_2973.PNG) _The toggle to permit time-sensitive notifications._

Once you’ve finished setting up your Focus, you’ll end up on the Focus mode’s setting menu, where there are a few additional things you’ll be able to configure. You can also get back here at any time by heading to “Settings” > “Focus,” then selecting the Focus mode you want to edit. 

  * The Focus Status menu will let you decide whether contacts will see a notice if you’re in an active Focus mode and their messages are muted. (Although right now, the only app that supports the feature is Apple’s Messages.)
  * The Home Screen menu allows you to hide specific home screens on your iPad or iPhone when you’re in a Focus mode. Combined with iOS 15’s App Library and the new ability to create multiple copies of an app icon, you can use this feature to customize what your phone looks like in different situations. 
  * The Lock Screen menu offers the option to show or hide silenced notifications on the lock screen or to dim the lock screen when the Focus mode is active.

Finally, there’s the actual activation of a Focus mode. Apple offers two ways to turn on a Focus mode: you can either manually select it from the moon icon in Control Center or schedule it automatically (settings for which can be found in the Focus menu).

The simplest option is “Smart Activation,” which has your device automatically toggle a Focus on its own. But you can also add more granular manual controls, activating a Focus for specific times, when you’re at a specific location, or when you’re using specific apps.

# "iOS 15 brings powerful new features to stay connected, focus, explore, and more"

*22-07-2021 22:06* 

> Apple previews major updates to FaceTime, Focus, enhanced on-device intelligence, and new ways to explore the world using Maps, Weather, and Wallet.
PRESS RELEASE June 7, 2021

Apple previews major updates to FaceTime, new Focus features to reduce distraction, enhanced on-device intelligence to discover information, and more ways to explore the world using Maps, Weather, and Wallet

iOS 15 introduces SharePlay in FaceTime, Live Text using on-device intelligence, redesigned Notifications, and more.

Cupertino, California Apple today announced iOS 15, a major update with powerful features that enhance the iPhone experience. [iOS 15](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/) makes FaceTime calls more natural, introduces SharePlay for shared experiences, helps users focus and be in the moment with new ways to manage notifications, and brings more intelligence to photos and search to quickly access information. Apple Maps unveils beautiful new ways to explore the world, Weather is redesigned with full-screen maps and more graphical displays of data, Wallet adds support for home keys and ID cards, and browsing the internet with Safari is even simpler with a new tab bar design and Tab Groups. iOS 15 also includes new privacy controls in Siri, Mail, and more places across the system to further protect user information.

“For many customers, iPhone has become indispensable, and this year we’ve created even more ways it can enhance our daily lives,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “iOS 15 helps users stay connected while sharing experiences in real time, gives them new tools to help reduce distraction and find focus, uses intelligence to enhance the photos experience, and, with huge upgrades to Maps, brings new ways to explore the world. We can’t wait for customers to experience it.”

## **More Natural FaceTime Calls and Shared Experiences with SharePlay**

FaceTime helps customers easily connect with those who matter most and with iOS 15, conversations with friends and family feel even more natural. With spatial audio, voices in a FaceTime call sound as if they are coming from where the person is positioned on the screen,1 and new microphone modes separate the user’s voice from background noise. Inspired by the stunning portrait photos taken on iPhone, Portrait mode is now available for FaceTime and designed specifically for video calls, so users can blur their background and put themselves in focus.2 While using Group FaceTime, a new grid view enables participants to see more faces at the same time.

The stunning Portrait mode from the Camera app is now optimized for video calls in FaceTime.

Users can now share experiences with SharePlay while connecting with friends on FaceTime, including listening to songs together with Apple Music, watching a TV show or movie from Apple TV+ and other streaming services in sync, or sharing their screen to view apps together. SharePlay works across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and with shared playback controls, anyone in a SharePlay session can play, pause, or jump ahead. SharePlay even extends to Apple TV, so users can watch shows or movies on a big screen. Disney+, ESPN+, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount+, Pluto TV, TikTok, Twitch, and many others are integrating SharePlay into their apps — creating entirely new ways to connect.

SharePlay makes it easy to listen to songs together in Apple Music while on a FaceTime call.

FaceTime calls also extend beyond Apple devices with the ability to create a link from iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and share it through Messages, Calendar, Mail, or third-party apps, so anyone can join a FaceTime call from their web browser on Android and Windows devices.3 FaceTime calls on the web remain end-to-end encrypted, so privacy is not compromised.

## **Tools to Find Focus**

iOS 15 delivers powerful tools that help users focus and reduce distraction. Focus is a new feature that filters notifications and apps based on what a user wants to focus on. Customers can set their device to help them be in the moment by creating a custom Focus or selecting a suggested Focus, which uses on-device intelligence to suggest which people and apps are allowed to notify them. Focus suggestions are based on users’ context, like during their work hours or while they’re winding down for bed, and when Focus is set on one Apple device, it automatically applies to their other Apple devices. Users can create Home Screen pages with apps and widgets that apply to moments of focus to only display relevant apps and reduce temptation. When a user’s Focus is blocking incoming notifications, their status is automatically displayed to others in Messages, reflecting that a user is not currently reachable.

Focus helps users filter notifications to reduce distractions, using a custom Focus or a suggested Focus like Work or Sleep.

## **New Notifications Experience**

Notifications have been redesigned, adding contact photos for people and larger icons for apps that make them even easier to identify. To help reduce distraction, a new notification summary collects non-time-critical notifications for delivery at a more opportune time, such as in the morning and evening. Using on-device intelligence, notifications are arranged by priority, with the most relevant notifications rising to the top, and based on a user’s interactions with apps. Urgent messages will be delivered immediately, so important communications will not end up in the summary, and it’s easy to temporarily mute any app or messaging thread for the next hour or for the day.

Notifications have a new look with larger icons for apps, to make them easier to identify, and a new notification summary.

## **On-Device Intelligence Powers Live Text, Advanced Spotlight Search, and More**

Live Text uses on-device intelligence to recognize text in a photo and allow users to take action. For example, users can search for and locate the picture of a handwritten family recipe, or capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call. With the power of the Apple Neural Engine, the Camera app can also quickly recognize and copy text in the moment, such as the Wi-Fi password displayed at a local coffee shop. With Visual Look Up, users can learn more about popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers found in nature, breeds of pets, and even find books.

Spotlight now uses intelligence to search photos by location, people, scenes, or objects, and using Live Text, Spotlight can find text and handwriting in photos. Spotlight now offers web image search and all-new rich results for actors, musicians, TV shows, and movies. Enhanced results for contacts show recent conversations, shared photos, and even their location if shared through Find My. 

Photos includes the biggest update ever to Memories, with a fresh new look, an interactive interface, and integration with Apple Music, which uses on-device intelligence to personalize song suggestions that bring memories to life.

## **A Redesigned Browsing Experience with Safari**

Safari gets a new design that makes controls easier to reach with one hand and puts content front and center. The new tab bar is compact and lightweight, and floats at the bottom of the screen, so users can easily swipe between tabs. Tab Groups allow users to save tabs and easily access them at any time across iPhone, iPad, or Mac. New features, such as the customizable start page and web extensions on iOS, make Safari even more personal and powerful.

Safari is redesigned with a new tab bar and Tab Groups for an even better browsing experience.

## **Explore the World with Apple Maps**

Apple is committed to building the world’s best map, and iOS 15 takes Maps even further with brand new ways to navigate and explore. Users will experience significantly enhanced details in cities for neighborhoods, commercial districts, elevation, and buildings, new road colors and labels, custom-designed landmarks, and a new night-time mode with a moonlit glow. This is a whole new way of looking at the world through Maps.

An all-new city navigation and exploration experience comes to Apple Maps with more realistic and colorful details.

When navigating using iPhone or CarPlay, Maps features a three-dimensional city-driving experience with new road details that help users better see and understand important details like turn lanes, medians, bike lanes, and pedestrian crosswalks.4 Transit riders can find nearby stations more easily and pin favorite lines. Maps automatically follows along with a selected transit route, notifying users when it’s nearly time to disembark, and riders can even keep track on Apple Watch. With iOS 15, users can simply hold up iPhone, and Maps generates a highly accurate position to deliver detailed walking directions in augmented reality.

## **New Keys and State IDs Come to Apple Wallet**

Apple Wallet adds support for additional types of keys, making it possible to access everyday places with just a tap. Last summer, Apple introduced digital car keys, and BMW was the first car company to add its keys, allowing users to tap to unlock. This year, digital car keys get even better with support for Ultra Wideband technology, so users can securely unlock and start their supported vehicle without removing their iPhone from a pocket or bag.5 iPhone can also be used to unlock a user’s home, office, or even a hotel room — all through keys stored in Wallet.6

Later this year, customers in participating states in the US will be able to add their driver’s license or state IDs to Wallet. The Transportation Security Administration is working to enable airport security checkpoints as the first place customers can use their digital Identity Card in Wallet. Identity Cards in Wallet are encrypted and safely stored in the Secure Element, the same hardware technology that makes Apple Pay private and secure.

## **New Privacy Features**

iOS 15 introduces even more privacy controls to help protect user information. With on-device speech recognition, audio of Siri requests is now processed entirely on iPhone by default,7 and performance improves significantly. Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from learning whether an email has been opened, and hides IP addresses so senders can’t learn a user’s location or use it to build a profile on them. App Privacy Report offers an overview of how apps use the access that has been granted to location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts in the last seven days, and which other domains are contacted.8

App Privacy Report provides more detail on how apps use the access that has been granted to them.

## **Redesigned Weather and Notes Apps**

Weather includes more graphical displays of weather data, full-screen maps, and dynamic layouts that change based on conditions. Beautifully redesigned animated backgrounds more accurately reflect the sun’s position and precipitation, and notifications highlight when rain or snow starts and stops.

Weather is redesigned with data and layouts that change based on conditions, such as heavy rain.

Notes adds user-created tags that make it easy to quickly categorize notes, and mentions allow members of shared notes to notify one another of important updates. An all-new Activity view shows the recent history of a shared note.

Notes adds user-created tags that make it easy to quickly categorize notes in line with relevant content.

## **Additional Features**

-   **Siri** adds Announce Notifications on AirPods, the ability for users to share what’s on their screen just by asking, and more.

-   **Shared with You** works across the system to find the articles, music, TV shows, photos, and more that are shared in Messages conversations, and conveniently surfaces them in apps like Photos, Safari, Apple News, Music, Podcasts, and the Apple TV app, making it easy to quickly access the information in context.

-   **iCloud+** combines everything users love about iCloud with new premium features, including Hide My Email, expanded HomeKit Secure Video support, and an innovative new internet privacy service, iCloud Private Relay, at no additional cost.9 Current iCloud subscribers will be upgraded to iCloud+ automatically this fall. All iCloud+ plans can be shared with people in the same Family Sharing group, so everyone can enjoy the new features, storage, and elevated experience that comes with the service. 

-   The **Health** app gets a new sharing tab that lets users share their health data with family, caregivers, or a care team, Trends gives users a way to focus attention on meaningful changes in personal health metrics, and Walking Steadiness is a new metric that empowers people to proactively manage their fall risk.

-   **HomeKit** accessory makers can now enable “Hey Siri” in their products, allowing customers to talk to and get responses from Siri on third-party devices. “Hey Siri”-enabled accessories will relay requests through HomePod or HomePod mini and will support features such as Personal Requests, Intercom, timers, and alarms. Starting today, smart home device manufacturers can begin working with Apple to integrate Siri into their accessories.

-   **Find My** introduces new capabilities to help locate a device that has been turned off or erased, as well as live-streaming locations for family and friends who choose to share their location. Separation Alerts notify a user if they leave an AirTag, Apple device, or Find My network accessory behind in an unfamiliar location, and the Find My network now supports AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. A new Find My widget offers an at-a-glance view directly from the Home Screen. 

-   **Translate** adds a new Live Translate feature that makes conversation flow naturally across languages. Systemwide translation allows users to translate text anywhere on iPhone.

-   The **Apple TV** app now features a new row titled “For All of You” — showcasing a collection of shows and movies based on the interests of selected people or an entire household — perfect for movie nights.

-   **New iPhone setup** makes it more seamless than ever to get started with iPhone. Existing iPhone users can temporarily back up data to iCloud — even without a subscription — to easily transfer their data to a new iPhone. For those moving to iPhone for the first time, an improved “Move to iOS” experience easily transfers photo albums, files, folders, and Accessibility settings, so iPhone feels personal right from the start. 

-   **Accessibility** across iPhone expands with new features for VoiceOver that enable users to explore even more details about the people, text, table data, and other objects within images. In support of neurodiversity, new background sounds help minimize distractions, and for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, Made for iPhone supports new bidirectional hearing aids. Sound Actions customizes Switch Control to work with mouth sounds, and users can now customize display and text size on an app-by-app basis. Apple is also bringing support for recognizing imported audiograms — charts that show the results of a hearing test — to Headphone Accommodations.

# Testing Facetime in the Browser... Again

Yes, I already did this...

Though techncially I was not using my optimum setup for such an undertaking (and I couldn't sleep,) so I thought I'd try Open Facetime on my Heftiest PC during the most ideal possible conditions for my ISP very late Sunday night / early Monday morning.

Yes, apparently I will be getting notifications any time someone clicks on the following shortlink I made to a Facetime Web conversation... possibly for eternity?? https://bit.ly/facetimeweb

# "Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates" 
Nov 11, 2021 at 17:00
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5I3ymAUU4p_tO72sbtnRVKi8sHo=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal\(857x517:1183x843\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130117/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg) Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge

Apple’s fall software updates, [iOS 15](https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple) and [macOS Monterey](https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1), are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are _boring_. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?

There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its mind about how its operating systems and the rules that govern it work — _ _like when it allowed for third-party email and browser apps [in iOS 14 ](https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble)— there’s just less room for big additions. 

Second is the fact that — because Apple silos off virtually all its updates, big or small, to help pad out the “big” iOS release — smaller but useful quality of life improvements often get stuck waiting around months for the fall cycle to line up.

Take iOS 15, which added a grid view and the ability to blur a background in FaceTime, core features that have already been a key part of Zoom and Google Meet’s toolkits for making larger virtual conversations more organized. Neither appears to be the kind of earth-shattering, OS-level feature that would require waiting for a new version of iOS, but Apple saved the updates to be part of iOS 15 anyway, despite the fact that they undoubtedly would have been more useful during the height of the pandemic when video chatting was more heavily in need.

Apple has, in fairness, already started to trend away from its one-and-done updates, if only because [it’s missed its self-imposed deadlines](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control) multiple times. Major features for iOS and macOS like SharePlay or Universal Control have been delayed from the initial dot-zero builds for more development time. Point releases have gotten more and more important, too, used to [debut new emoji](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936510/apple-ios-13-2-airpods-pro-compatible), [critical Face ID updates for better mask support](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265019/apple-ios-13-5-out-now-unlock-iphone-face-mask-id-exposure-notification-covid-19), or [Apple’s high-profile App Tracking Transparency requirement](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking).

To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about. 

Spaced out software updates wouldn’t even be a new idea for Apple, at least on the macOS side of things. Apple spent almost a decade spacing out OS X releases every two years before it brought back annual releases with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012.

Spaced out updates aren’t a new idea for Apple, either

Sure, Apple does get some benefit from its current cadence. On a basic level, bundling iOS and macOS updates gives Apple a single, cohesive marketing push, a package of features that it can point to and say, “Look, here are all the ways the new software makes your life better.” The annual releases also mean that Apple can count on journalists writing roundups of the new features every year at WWDC and reviews of those new features in the fall, and Apple might have to risk that consistent coverage if it changes things up. 

But while the boosted public awareness is nice, I doubt that Apple would be missing out on much if it spaced out annual releases. New iPhones are not sold on the strength of having Apple’s new software installed; customers praised the [M1 MacBook Airs](https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon) because of their battery life and processing speed, not because they shipped with [macOS Big Sur](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1).

People install iOS and macOS updates, but outside of the tech sphere, it’s not something that people are _eager_ to do. More often than not, Apple updates are installed out of a grudging frustration at push notifications and a desire to banish alert bubbles, not because Focus modes allow power users to set up more granular do-not-disturb settings.

Spacing out iOS and macOS updates for when Apple actually has big marquee features to show off (like it did during the OS X days when it actually _charged_ for new updates) could go a long way to fixing that unenthusiastic update cycle. Less frequent iOS updates could help make sure that there’s actually something to get excited for, like a new visual design or substantial new features (like Siri). Additionally, Apple would get more time to develop new versions of its software, which could theoretically cut down on the bugs and glitches in the final versions of whatever it does ship. 

Smaller updates, meanwhile, can be doled out over the year when they’re ready, instead of waiting to cluster every minor update into a massive, overwhelming grab bag once a year where they’re more likely to be overshadowed anyway by the more substantial parts of the new operating system. More gradual updates that aren’t tied to a single major release is an idea we know works, too, because it’s how every other third-party app on iOS already handles updates.

But right now, Apple’s system of annual releases leaves it with the worst of both worlds: siloed updates that come too infrequently for minor features while still not having enough major features to be worth the hype. If Apple can’t make macOS and iOS updates more substantial, it might be time to leave the annual release cycle behind.
