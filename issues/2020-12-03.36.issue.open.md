THE RUGGED SON
 
Discovering a forgotten need.
For the past few months, Hawthorn has been unironically and unconceitedly introducing me into the World of Film photography. I’ve taken a lot of photos in my lifetime, but almost exclusively in digital save for some pre-adolescent experimenting with a 35mm Olympus point-and-shoot, so let me disclaim this review as perhaps not the most useful to old time film nerds. For them, other resources like Forgotten Charm or Michael Butkus would better inform a buying decision.
 
Kodak’s 110 Instamatic film format led to a surprisingly diverse variety of “pocket cameras,” and a great many of them are exceptionally beautiful examples of design. Despite its original, limited intended function, the industry pushed 110’s limits in the 1970s and 80s, from keychain microcameras – little more than an aperture mounted on the cartridges themselves – to SLRs with adjustable focus, exposure, and interchangeable lenses.
omg you guys I just got my pentax auto 110 and ITS SO SMALL!!! i'm legitimately too excited to clean it off so take a big look!! pic.twitter.com/25Hk1G8E7h

The second great explosion of American Buddhism occurred in the nineteen-fifties. Spurred, in large part, by the writings of the émigré Japanese scholar D. T. Suzuki, it was, in the first instance, aesthetic: Suzuki’s work, though rich in tea ceremonies and haiku, makes no mention of Zazen, the hyper-disciplined, often painful, meditation practice that is at the heart of Zen practice.
 
The Buddhist spirit, or the easier American variant of it, blossomed in Beat literature, producing some fine coinages (Kerouac’s “Dharma Bums”). Zen, though apparently an atypically severe sect within Buddhism, came to be the standard-bearer, so much so that “Zen” became an all-purpose modifier in American letters meaning “challengingly counterintuitive”—as in “Zen and the Art of Archery” or the masterly “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,” where you learn how not to aim your arrow or how to find a spiritual practice in a Harley.
 
It was this second movement that blossomed into a serious practice of sitting lessons and a set of institutions, the most prominent, perhaps, being the San Francisco Zen Center.
 
Though separated by generations, the deeper grammar of the two Buddhist awakenings was essentially the same. Buddhism in America is simultaneously exotic and familiar—it has lots of Eastern trappings and ceremonies that set it off from the materialism of American life, but it also speaks to an especially American longing for a publicly productive spiritual practice. American Buddhism spins off museum collections and Noh-play translations and vegetarian restaurants and philosophical books and, in the hands of the occasional Buddhist Phil Jackson, the triangle offense in basketball.
Orbital plane, the rain stays the same. Make mine a regex and yours will be pain.
