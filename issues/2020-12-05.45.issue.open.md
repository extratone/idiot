Apparently I'm going to have to go back and find what Twitter has deleted from the iPhone 12 Pro Max Twitter Moment because Moments have a silent 98 Tweet limit. I'm going to have to gather them as well as what's left of the Moment, currently, and migrate the Tweets to [this collection](http://bit.ly/ip12pmtw). (Yes, that's a shortlink.)

Apparently, the only way to accomplish this is to do it through Tweetdeck, so this is definitely a task that's going to have to be done on desktop.

# The Psalms' New Telegram Channel
I've created [**yet another Telegram channel**](https://t.me/neoyokel) that I'm going to attempt to use to share related media/documentation/minutia as I have been here but in a slightly different format. I thought I would try it because 1.) I want to take more advantage of Telegram, generally and 2.) I should avoid using GitHub as a file sharing service, and using Telegram as a substitution when particular challenges become an issue might actually stick.

I was worried that having the sideloaded shit on there _and_ running on a dev beta build was slowing the phone down, but I just recorded the best of the three Geekbench 5 runs I've ever put the phone through lol.

# The State of Notetaking With Git Integration on iOS
_This was originally intended as a response to [a post on the Obsidian forums](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-github-integration-for-sync-and-version-control/6369), but apparently it included too many hyperlinks for one's post there, so trying to post it got my account suspended. (lol)_

Regarding Git on iOS, I just wanted to pop in and and share [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) since it wasn't mentioned. 

I've spent the past eight or nine months playing around with Git as integrated into the entirety of my writing/notetaking/curating/documenting process. ([here's the primary subject repo](https://github.com/extratone/bilge), if you're curious, but there's nothing particularly special about anything I've done with it so far.)

in the past three months, especially, this has involved working more on my new iPhone than I have since community college, when my iPhone 4 was my only computer for three semesters. (*that* is a good story lol)

I think I have a fairly good picture of Git on iOS, specifically, after all the reading and testing (screwing around) I've done.

here are the bullet points:
* for a brief period between 2017 and Fall, 2018, there was finally a text editor with relatively non-janky integration with Files called [**Textor**](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/textor-the-ios-equivalent-of-textedit-integrated-with-files/).
* Textor was [removed from the app store](https://twitter.com/louisdhauwe/status/1052003267612299266) when its developer was hired by Apple in [October of 2018](https://github.com/louisdh/textor/issues/27).
* Brett Terpstra's [excellent database of text editors](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/) currently lists three as having integration with Files: [Paper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paper-writing-app/id1476984841), [Pretext](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pretext/id1347707000), and [Writemator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/writemator/id1326574914). (Haven't tried any of them yet, though.)  

Personally, I would rather go through the hassle to write in Bear and export to Working Copy every once in a while than any other workflow I've found yet because I love how both apps look and work, but maybe I'm just superficial lol.

# Most Intriguing Apps

## An ongoing list of links to iOS apps, App Stories, and greater media coverage.

[**The Gist**](https://gist.github.com/extratone/0376f75114ac4104fc336ca7784d2174) is probably the best way to keep up with this at the moment. (Here's a [shortlink](**url**): `http://bit.ly/dbintrigue`)

I’ve privately maintained a list like this for as long as I can remember, to be honest, but it’s never been particularly useful to others until now. Though it’ll probably never be alphabatized, standardized, or comprehensively annotated, it *will* be kept relatively up-to-date - certainly for the duration of my iPhone 12 Pro Max long review.

I finally received the Apple Support scam call I asked for for Christmas! 

The end result wasn't all that exciting - she hung up as soon as I asked her which iCloud account of mine she was referring to.

It almost certainly doesn't matter, but here are the two numbers involved.

The number of the caller: 
**+1 (800) 297-2199**
The number from which I received an RDP invite link via SMS: 
**+1 (844) 334-6022**

# Enpass for iOS App Store Review

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/112266228-b7d6c280-8c41-11eb-8681-a32318b02695.png)
I've praised Enpass for years, most recently [on my blog](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts) and subsequently [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1253384547405791235). As someone who's been using password managers since the oughts, I can tell you with some authority that Enpass - as a cross-platform, cloud sync-enabled method of managing your credentials - remains pretty darn good.

I, myself, have become far too dependent on Enpass to move until I deem it absolutely necessary, but I debated recommending it over current popular competitors (Lastpass) as well as old school entires (1Password, which is notably the only other password manager I've used) for new users because of recent changes to the desktop app's UI (menus??) and not-quite-as-silky-smooth operation of the iOS app, but I expect this is simply a low point in the cycle, and Enpass will once again reach a point where it's the prettiest, once again.

I really only have one request for the iOS team, and it likely only applies to me: **keyboard shortcut integration**. I have begun to suspect I might be the only iPhone user in its history to make extensive use of hardware keyboard integration, but I have to say, 1Password's support of the ⌘+F shortcut to bring the cursor to the search bar after FaceID/TouchID/general authentication would be an *incredibly* helpful addition to the Enpass iOS app. I would be very interested in hearing about how difficult such keyboard shortcut implementation is in iOS development, generally, also.

Thanks!

​
Analysts at Wedbush today said that supply chain checks suggest that the next generation iPhone lineup, colloquially referred to as iPhone 13, will feature a 1 TB high-end storage option for the first time. The current [iPhone 12 maxes out at 512 GB capacity](https://amzn.to/37VPWSu).
​
The financial analysts remain optimistic that Apple iPhone sales will continue to be strong through this year as part of the post-pandemic ‘reopening environment’ as COVID vaccine rollouts continue worldwide.
​
Front Page Tech [previously reported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgeTioKF6mU&feature=emb_title) that the next-generation iPhone 13 lineup would feature a 1 TB storage option in January.
​
As far as iOS devices are concerned, Apple has currently only offered 1 TB of storage on its high-end iPad Pro tablets. In context of the wider smartphone market, the iPhone has lagged a little behind here. For instance, smartphone competitor Samsung began offering 1 TB phones with the Galaxy S10 series almost two years ago.
​
The iPhone 13 lineup is expected to launch this fall, although we still don’t know much about the device’s specifications. There have been persistent rumors of the return of Touch ID and 120Hz high-refresh rate screens but nothing particularly concrete.
​
Until the launch of the iPhone 13 in the fall, Wedbush analysts remain bullish on the iPhone 12 sales performance, following Apple’s blow-out $110 billion holiday quarter. The firm estimates around 62 million iPhone 11 units for the March quarter, and around 40 million for the June quarter. The analysts compare the success to the record iPhone 6 sales cycle of 2014.

# "The best phone for telling yourself that you don’t need an actual camera"

For years now we’ve been told that phone cameras are so good that you don’t need an actual camera. The iPhone 12 Pro Max might be the best example of that yet. It’s got a bigger sensor! It’s got three focal lengths! It can shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR!

At the end of the day, it’s still a phone camera and can’t really hold a candle to the image quality or creative control you get with a larger mirrorless camera. But hey, it’s fun to live in that lie and you can totally see the difference between the 12 Pro Max images and other phones. When you blow them up on a big screen. And zoom in.

# "Latest iOS and iPadOS 15 Betas Allow Apps to Request Access to More RAM"

Apple is taking a major stride that will allow developers to improve the performance of their apps on iPhones and iPads, by giving apps the ability to access more of a device's memory or RAM starting later this fall.

![ipad pro with m1 chip](https://images.macrumors.com/t/geWI6Iif0Kor3fl2oqGWMBpldNg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/04/ipad-pro-with-m1-chip.jpeg?lossy)  
Currently, apps are limited to the amount of RAM they can use, regardless of the amount available on the device. For example, despite the highest-end M1 iPad Pro featuring 16GB of RAM, on iPadOS 14, [apps are limited to only use 5GB](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/ipados-limits-app-ram-even-on-m1-ipad-pro/). 16GB of RAM is the highest amount of RAM ever offered in an iPhone or iPad, and the 5GB limitation means that apps aren't able to utilize even half of what the iPad Pro has to offer.

In the second betas of iOS and iPadOS 15, [released to developers yesterday](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/ios-15-beta-2/), Apple is [introducing a new entitlement that developers may request](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_kernel_increased-memory-limit) that will expose their apps to more memory. Apple says that this entitlement will inform the system that an app "may perform better by exceeding the default app memory limit." Apple's developer documentation doesn't specify how much extra RAM an app may be exposed to and also says this is limited to "supported devices."  

> Add this entitlement to your app to inform the system that some of your app's core features may perform better by exceeding the default app memory limit on supported devices. If you use this entitlement, make sure your app still behaves correctly if additional memory isn't available.

While Apple doesn't specify the amount of extra RAM an app may request, the wording of the documentation, which advises developers to use a function to "determine the amount of memory available," suggests the ceiling of memory apps may request may be relatively high.

It's unlikely that Apple will allow developers to utilize the full amount of memory on a device. While that scenario may be useful for high-end professional apps on the iPad Pro, it would significantly slow down the system and make it harder to multitask with different apps. Users of the iPad Pro, and more so recently thanks to the M1 iPad Pro, have complained that iPadOS is limiting the true potential performance of the iPad.

Despite many users' hopes, iPadOS 15 didn’t introduce any significant features that took full advantage of the hardware of the iPad, specifically the M1-powered iPad Pro. However, the ability for apps to request access to more on-device RAM will go a long way in apps being able to utilize even more of what a device has to offer.

The new entitlement is available for developers to test, but it won't be made available to apps on the App Store until this fall when iOS and iPadOS 15, alongside watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey are made available.

**This post is best experienced in dark mode.**

It’s hard to believe, but it’s been 14 years since Apple shipped the first iPhones. On this day in 2007, Apple Stores across the United States hosted the “iPhone World Premiere,” and life was never the same. Looking back on that day, it’s clear that it marked a turning point. It was the beginning of a revolution in basically every single industry. 

It fundamentally changed the way almost every task is accomplished. It spawned entirely new industries and ideas. We take our iPhones for granted today, but life before the iPhone was very different. Let’s take a look back at the day the world changed in the blink of an eye.

At 2 p.m. on June 29, 2007 Apple Stores closed to prepare for the premiere. Just a few hours later at 6 p.m. Apple Stores opened their doors to long lines of anxious Apple fans who had been waiting six months to get their hands on the borderline mythical device. It was a very special day and people knew it. Whether you waited in line in a mall or in the queue at a big city store like Apple Fifth Avenue in New York, the energy was the same. 

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Premiereheader-1.gif)

Longtime Apple retail enthusiast Gary Allen, who sadly passed away in 2015, left behind one of the most incredible resources for Apple fans. His Flickr page is chock full of incredible albums from store openings, product launches, and more. One of Gary’s best albums is from the [iPhone World Premiere](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifostore/albums/72157626940600161/with/5879782568/) at the Apple Store in Palo Alto.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-11.png)Apple fans line up outside of Apple Palo Alto._ Photo: Gary Allen_

His photos capture the very first time Apple fans lined up in droves to get their hands on an iPhone. In every year that followed, fans would continue to line up to get their hands on the next generation of iPhone. The excitement wouldn’t wane either, in fact I’d say it grew continuously over the years.

One of the coolest things Apple did for the launch of the original iPhone was to create giant phones that were displayed in store windows. These iPhones displays a gorgeous countdown that led up to the moment the doors opened, with large Myriad Pro numbers in a sleek silver gradient. All of Apple’s static in-store graphics somehow captured the magic of the device, particularly the magic of multi-touch.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-3-1.png)The large display iPhones made for the launch. _Photo: Ed Kohler_

Right before the doors opened, employees peeled away the curtains hiding their preparations. In the photo below you can see store employees at Apple’s store in Seattle removing the curtains as a camera crew watches on. The iPhone launch was covered heavily by the traditional media and you can see camera crews in just about every single shot from that day, regardless of the city.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-5-2.png)Apple Store employees in Seattle peel back the curtain. _Photo: Eli Duke_

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak was first in line at his local Apple Store at the Valley Fair Mall in San Jose. This awesome photo taken by Anuj Biyani captured the moment the doors opened and Woz entered the store. You can see him wearing a shirt that says “The line starts here.” Lots of people that day wore shirts that celebrated the launch, while many others wore shirts advertising their business knowing the press was covering the event.

Fans who lined up at Apple Palo Alto didn’t know it, but they were in for a special surprise. Apple Palo Alto happened to be Steve Jobs’s local store and it wasn’t uncommon to see him in downtown Palo Alto. On launch day he stopped by the store with his wife Laurene to visit with friends and fans. In the photo below, you can see him chatting with longtime friends and original Macintosh team members Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson.

I can’t forget to give some credit to the online store. You know how Apple takes down the store before releasing a new product? They did just that on June 29, 2007 with a special page designed just for the iPhone launch. Luckily, [François Proulx](https://www.flickr.com/photos/francois/664513846/in/photolist-21HNPh-21EqDK-21HQyo-21XSbi-22DowU-23waD2-21JHma-23waW8-21KqDa-22bTNA-21DP3V-26kNW8-24zq7y-21Dhf8-2297Yw-22pCkJ-21skYe-21BNqg-22rPxv-22CZVu-21BJbM-22kjD9-22kj25-21J4jS-21FjyK-25igmV-21SP1R-21DCLe-24GQrM-21J6A7-24uYvk-21LCQ9-21H1uE-2tUACd-22quYE-21Jvkh-22TNBr-224YoD-2iK9U5-22tsZA-21H1uY-24E91R-21Kmyp-21XKwW-23zMix-21FjKH-26ihoz-21Fk1c-21SmNH-21SoaP) on Flickr saved and posted a screenshot of the page.

The iPhone World Premiere set the bar for future product launches. It showed just how excited the world was and just how important many of us expected it to be. It turned consumer product launches into a phenomenon. You weren’t just waiting to buy a product, you were waiting to buy the future. One [Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/theritters/albums/72157600556030517) from the original launch I came across is full of photos of the phones customers had while waiting in line. It really highlights just how big of a deal that day was.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/merchheader-1.gif)

For the launch of the original iPhone, Apple employees were given two shirts. The first was to be worn ahead of the launch. It had a single Calendar icon marking the Friday, June 29, launch date with a simple “The wait is almost over” tagline. Once the iPhone was launched, shirts displayed the simple, “Say hello to iPhone.”

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-14.png)iPhone launch shirts given to employees. _Photo: SportsCards_

Of course these two shirts are fairly rare these days and occasionally appear for sale on the web. I’d argue that the pre-launch shirt is one of, if not, the most important piece of Apple Store memorabilia.

Customers who purchased an original iPhone were given a special limited-edition shopping bag. It was a higher-quality board bag with fabric handles, rather than the plastic sling bags regularly used at the time. It had a beautiful depiction of a glowing iPhone on the side with shiny text below it. The bag itself is now a collector’s item. It was designed to match the box of the original iPhone.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-3.png)The iPhone launch bag _Photo: lambo_

The box for the original iPhone was famously designed by Apple’s now head of human interface, Alan Dye. Dye [told students at Syracuse University](https://thenextweb.com/news/how-alan-dye-went-from-iphone-box-designer-to-apples-head-of-ui) that every single black iPhone box had to have its corners painted so as not to have any color inconsistency. They “wanted a box that was completely black.” It was the kind of attention to detail we expected from Apple.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-15.png)The original iPhone box _Photo: Powerbook Medic_

Inside the box was a whole host of accessories. Apple included a special white plastic dock that was designed specifically for the original iPhone in addition to the large power brick, earbuds, and 30 pin connector cable. Another goodie included in the box was a black microfiber cloth with “iPhone” embossed on it. The original box also included a crystal-clear tray that held the iPhone. Later, iPhones would use thinner black or white trays.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-7-1.png)Lucky you sticker on the original iPhone._ Photo: Jay Tong_

Some iPhone boxes even got a special “Lucky you.” sticker placed on them at the time of purchase. It was a very nice little touch and something Apple stores did in the mid to late 2000s. 

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/accessories-1.gif)

While the iPhone included several common accessories in the box, Apple sold a few optional ones as well. The most interesting one was without a doubt the iPhone Bluetooth Headset. It was a single black earbud with a button and charging pins on the bottom. The shape of the earbud itself resembled the standard iPod headphones but attached to a wireless bluetooth stem.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-2-3.png)

The iPhone’s Bluetooth Headset was very similar to modern day AirPods. It had a unique black design that set it apart from Apple’s standard iPod headphones. It included a unique 30-pin connector cable in the box that let you simultaneously charge your iPhone and your Bluetooth Headset. The box itself was actually a miniaturized version of the iPhone’s box. It had the same top sliding black box that revealed the earpiece in a clear tray. The headset itself was priced at $129, not too far off from what AirPods usually cost when they are on sale today.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-5.png)

Apple also sold a special version of the dock that was included in the iPhone’s box, but with a charger for the Bluetooth Headset. It cost $49 on top of the $129 for the headset. Another accessory Apple sold for the original iPhone was a TTY adapter that connected via the headphone jack. The adapter allowed you to connect your iPhone to TTY accessories for users who are deaf or heard of hearing. 

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/tty-4.gif)The iPhone TTY adapter

Apple continued to sell the adapter for many years, and while it’s no longer for sale, [the listing](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA854G/A/apple-iphone-tty-adapter?fnode=67a64350fcdf15e9f374c163e06d57331202dd7fd7fcae1e2d1c5ff4e432f639cfca2ca882f380f85999db6121def0e42bb99025c8b18d0e20177ee7cba45f7817c6d3b1bf8c5fa9aca1c98a2586202c3b5809fa5c43f99c7ab3c501bae43bcc6a396155afc7952352b5d90786403986&fs=s%3Dnewest) is still on [Apple.com](http://Apple.com). The TTY adapter was compatible with all iPhones that had a headphone jack, meaning all iPhones from the original to the iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, and SE worked with it.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-7.png)iPhone stereo headsets on Apple store shelves. _Photo: Jun Seita_

Another accessory that Apple originally created just for the iPhone was their earbuds with a built-in remote and microphone. They were officially called the “iPhone Stereo Headset” but later became standard with Apple devices when they gained volume up and down buttons.

Nowadays it’s totally normal for companies to seed tons of review units of upcoming devices to publications big and small. But for the launch of the original iPhone, Apple only passed out a handful of units to some very lucky writers. Apple seeded a unit to the legendary Walt Mossberg in addition to Katherine Boehert, David Pogue, Ed Baig, Steven Levy, and Phil Baker. 

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-16.png)Walt Mossberg’s original iPhone video review

Walt Mossberg reviewed the iPhone with fellow _Wall Street Journal_ writer Katherine Boehret. They both believed the iPhone to be a hit and said that it would set a new bar for the cell phone market. They said in their [written review](http://allthingsd.com/20070626/the-iphone-is-breakthrough-handheld-computer/):

> We have been testing the iPhone for two weeks, in multiple usage scenarios, in cities across the country. Our verdict is that, despite some flaws and feature omissions, the iPhone is, on balance, a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer. Its software, especially, sets a new bar for the smart-phone industry, and its clever finger-touch interface, which dispenses with a stylus and most buttons, works well, though it sometimes adds steps to common functions.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/Artboard-Copy-4.png)Mossberg and Boehret’s review of the original iPhone _Photo: AllThingsD_

David Pogue at the_ New York Times_ titled [his review](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/technology/circuits/27pogue.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin), “The iPhone Matches Most of Its Hype.” Pogue said in his review, “As it turns out, much of the hype and some of the criticisms are justified. The iPhone is revolutionary…” Ed Baig at _USA Today_ [detailed](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/2007-06-26-iphone-review_N.htm) a wide variety of aspects of the original iPhone that set it apart from the rest of the smartphone industry. [Steven Levy](https://www.newsweek.com/first-look-test-driving-iphone-102625) wrote for _Newsweek_ before the iPhone was even released, “In a sense, the iPhone has already made its mark.”

In the days that followed the original iPhone’s release, many other reviewers and publications you know today got their hands on the device. Jason Snell [wrote for _MacWorld_](https://www.macworld.com/article/186335/iphone-rev.html) in early July 2007:

> The iPhone is the real deal. It’s a product that has already changed the way people look at the devices they carry in their pockets and purses. After only a few days with mine, the prospect of carrying a cellphone with me wherever I go no longer fills me with begrudging acceptance, but actual excitement.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/videos-1.gif)

In addition to the many written reviews, tons of videos were posted, and they’re actually really fun to look back on. You can watch reviews from several sources, as well as Walt Mossberg’s, below:

One video that’s particularly special isn’t a review, but a tribute to Steve Jobs. Filmmaker Casey Neistat made a movie about waiting to buy the original iPhone back in 2007 but didn’t publish it until Steve had passed away in October of 2011. Neistat waited overnight in front of the AT&T store in Union Square to get his first iPhone and documented the experience.

Several other videos documented the special day, some even including brief appearances by Steve himself. You can still find many on YouTube, from news reports to fan documentaries. While many of these videos are low quality by today’s standards, they live on as time capsules that captured the spirit of the moment.

![](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/ctivate-1.gif)

One thing every single iPhone buyer had to do on launch day was [activate](https://www.wired.com/2007/06/iphone-registra/) their device at home. After returning from the Apple or AT&T store, users had to download the latest version of iTunes and connect their device to their computer. iTunes would then allow you to activate your iPhone on AT&T’s network.

The weirdest part of the process was choosing data and text plans right in iTunes. After your iPhone activated, which could take a considerably long amount of time due to the amount of people trying to activate their devices at the same time, you could sync your personal content.

Apple lauded the new activation process a few days before the iPhone World Premiere in a [press release](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/06/26Apple-and-AT-T-Announce-iTunes-Activation-and-Sync-for-iPhone/). It focused on how activation would be similar to setting up an iPod, making it instantly familiar to millions of people. Activation required iTunes 7.3 on a Mac with Mac OS X Tiger or a PC with Windows XP or Vista.

In the first 30 hours of sales, [Apple sold 270,000 iPhones](https://www.engadget.com/2007-07-25-apple-sold-270-000-iphones-in-the-first-30-hours.html). Within 74 days, [Apple had sold 1 million iPhones](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-1-million-iphones-sold/). Steve Jobs said it took nearly two years for that many iPods to be sold. iPhone was an instant hit. The company launched the first iPod touch to give customers the iPhone experience without the phone part in September 2007. They also cut the price of the 8GB iPhone and stopped selling the smaller 4GB model. Apple [gave iPhone buyers](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-to-offer-100-store-credit-to-iphone-customers/) who spent up to $200 more on the device a $100 store credit.

Now, 14 years later, Apple has more than 1 billion iPhones out in the world in active use. I’d call that a helluva success.

# [Somehow, My Grandfather's Age is Relevant to this review (thread)](https://mobile.twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1419771124662079493)

> damn... I just realized that my grandfather was born exactly 100 years before iPhone was launched (1907) yet was still present and coherent enough to scare the shit out of me for darn near my entire childhood.
> 
> like... for over a decade I knew this depression-era croaking motherfucker (he was **too old** to be in WWII...)
> 
> I had to piss in a chamber pot in his house because the stairs *really were that loud* as to wake a 95 year old man up in the middle of the night. 
> 
> and then he died at age 99. less than a year later, I wore my first-generation iPhone to the first day of 8th grade on a LEATHER BELT HOLSTER.
