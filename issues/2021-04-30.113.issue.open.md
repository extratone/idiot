## Support my exploration of Editorial With Git as I continue to study hands-on how we might best bring technology media's perspective back to the little realities of the individuals who *actually* build the functions and features of its foundation.

I'm David Blue and **I am not a software developer**. Though I do fairly regularly author and distribute various tool-adjacent configurations you may find of value, I am fundamentally *not a builder*, though I am relentlessly compelled to seek out spaces like GitHub where builders congregate around the context of work

Don’t forget to delete this placeholder text 🙃

Here are some ideas of what you can tell your potential sponsors:
- [ ] Who are you, and where are you from?
- [ ] What are you working on?
- [ ] Why is their sponsorship important? How will you use the funds?

Hint: You can include images and emojis in your bio!
```
