**Pegasus** is [spyware](/wiki/Spyware) developed by the Israeli [cyberarms firm](/wiki/Cyberarms_firm) [NSO Group](/wiki/NSO_Group) that can be covertly installed on [mobile phones](/wiki/Mobile_phone) (and other devices) running most[1] versions of [iOS](/wiki/IOS) and [Android](/wiki/Android_\(operating_system\)).[2] The 2021 [Project Pegasus revelations](/wiki/Project_Pegasus_revelations) suggest that current Pegasus software is able to exploit all recent iOS versions up to [iOS 14.6](/wiki/IOS_14#Updates).[1] According to the _Washington Post_ and other prominent media sources, Pegasus not only enables the keystroke monitoring of all communications from a phone (texts, emails, web searches) but it also enables phone call and location tracking, while also permitting NSO Group to hijack both the mobile phone's microphone and camera, thus turning it into a constant surveillance device.[3]

The company had previously been owned by American private equity firm [Francisco Partners](/wiki/Francisco_Partners),[4] then bought back by the founders in 2019.[5] NSO states that it provides "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime",[6][7] has published sections of contracts requiring customers only to use its products for criminal and national security investigations, and stated that it has an industry-leading approach to human rights.[8] The spyware is named after the mythical winged horse [Pegasus](/wiki/Pegasus)—it is a [Trojan horse](/wiki/Trojan_horse_\(computing\)) that can be sent "flying through the air" to infect phones.[9]

Pegasus was discovered in August 2018 after a failed attempt at installing it on an [iPhone](/wiki/IPhone) belonging to a [human rights activist](/wiki/Human_rights_activist) led to an investigation revealing details about the spyware, its abilities, and the [security vulnerabilities](/wiki/Vulnerability_\(computing\)) it exploited. As of 2016, Pegasus was capable of [reading text messages](/wiki/Phone_surveillance), [tracking calls](/wiki/Call-tracking_software), collecting passwords, [tracking location](/wiki/Mobile_phone_tracking), accessing the target device's microphone and camera,[3] and harvesting information from apps. News of the spyware caused significant media coverage. It was called the "most sophisticated" smartphone attack ever, and was the first time that a malicious remote exploit using [jailbreak](/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking) to gain unrestricted access to an iPhone had been detected.[6]

On August 23, 2020, according to intelligence obtained by the Israeli newspaper _[Haaretz](/wiki/Haaretz)_, the NSO Group was reported to have sold Pegasus spyware software for hundreds of millions of US dollars to the [United Arab Emirates](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) and other [Gulf States](/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf), for surveillance of anti-regime activists, journalists and political leaders from rival nations, with Israeli government encouragement and mediation.[10] Later, on December 2020, [Al Jazeera](/wiki/Al_Jazeera) investigation show [The Tip of the Iceberg](/wiki/The_Hidden_is_More_Immense), _Spy partners_, showed exclusive footage about Pegasus and its penetration into the phones of media professionals and activists, used by Israel to eavesdrop on its opponents and even its allies.[11][12]

In July 2021, widespread media coverage part of the [Project Pegasus revelations](/wiki/Project_Pegasus_revelations) along with an in-depth analysis by [human rights](/wiki/Human_rights) group [Amnesty International](/wiki/Amnesty_International) uncovered that Pegasus was still being widely exploited against high-profile targets. It showed that Pegasus was able to infect all modern iOS versions up to the latest release, iOS 14.6, through a zero-click [iMessage](/wiki/IMessage) exploit[1].

## Discovery

Pegasus' iOS exploitation was identified in August 2016. [Arab](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) human rights defender [Ahmed Mansoor](/wiki/Ahmed_Mansoor) received a text message promising "secrets" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates by following a link. Mansoor sent the link to [Citizen Lab](/wiki/Citizen_Lab), who investigated, with the collaboration of [Lookout](/wiki/Lookout_\(IT_security\)), finding that if Mansoor had followed the link it would have jailbroken his phone and implanted the spyware into it, in a form of [social engineering](/wiki/Social_engineering_\(security\)).[13] Citizen Lab linked the attack to the NSO Group. 

Regarding how widespread the issue was, Lookout explained in a blog post: "We believe that this spyware has been in the wild for a significant amount of time based on some of the indicators within the code" and pointed out that the code shows signs of a "kernel mapping table that has values all the way back to [iOS 7](/wiki/IOS_7)" (released 2013).[14] _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times)_ and _[The Times of Israel](/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel)_ both reported that it appeared that the [United Arab Emirates](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) was using this spyware as early as 2013.[15][16][17]

Several lawsuits outstanding in 2018 claimed that NSO Group helped clients operate the software and therefore participated in numerous violations of human rights initiated by its clients.[17] Two months after the murder and dismemberment of _[Washington Post](/wiki/Washington_Post)_ journalist [Jamal Khashoggi](/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi), a Saudi human rights activist, in the Saudi Arabian Consulate in [Istanbul, Turkey](/wiki/Istanbul,_Turkey), Saudi dissident [Omar Abdulaziz](/wiki/Omar_Abdulaziz_\(vlogger\)), a Canadian resident, filed suit in Israel against NSO Group, accusing the firm of providing the Saudi government with the surveillance software to spy on him and his friends, including Khashoggi.[3]

## Spyware details

The spyware can be installed on devices running certain versions of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, as well as some Android devices.[1] Rather than being a specific exploit, Pegasus is a suite of exploits which uses many vulnerabilities in the system. Infection vectors include clicking links, the Photos app, the Apple Music app, and iMessage. Some of the exploits Pegasus uses are zero-click—that is, they can run without any interaction from the victim. Once installed, Pegasus has been reported to be able to run arbitrary code, extract contacts, call logs, messages, photos, web browsing history, settings,[18] as well as gather information from apps including but not limited to communications apps [iMessage](/wiki/IMessage), [Gmail](/wiki/Gmail), [Viber](/wiki/Viber), Facebook, [WhatsApp](/wiki/WhatsApp), [Telegram](/wiki/Telegram_\(software\)), and [Skype](/wiki/Skype).[19]

At the 2017 Security Analyst Summit held by [Kaspersky Lab](/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab), researchers revealed that Pegasus was available for Android in addition to iOS; Google refers to the Android version as [Chrysaor, the brother of the winged horse Pegasus](/wiki/Chrysaor). Its functionality is similar to the iOS version, but the mode of attack is different. The Android version tries to gain [root access](/wiki/Rooting_\(Android\)) (similar to jailbreaking in iOS); if it fails, it asks the user for permissions that enable it to harvest at least some data. At the time Google said that only a few Android devices had been infected.[20]

Pegasus hides itself as far as is possible and self-destructs in an attempt to eliminate evidence if unable to communicate with its command-and-control server for over 60 days, or if on the wrong device. Pegasus can also do this on command.[20]

### Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network

Human rights group Amnesty International reported in the 2021 [Project Pegasus revelations](/wiki/Project_Pegasus_revelations) that Pegasus employs a sophisticated [command-and-control](/wiki/Command_and_control_\(malware\)) (C&C) infrastructure to deliver exploit payloads and send commands to Pegasus targets. There are at least four known iterations of the C&C infranstructure, dubbed the _Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network_ (PATN) by NSO group, each encompassing up to 500 [domain names](/wiki/Domain_name), [DNS servers](/wiki/Domain_Name_System), and other network infrastructure. The PATN reportedly utilizes techniques such as registering high [port numbers](/wiki/Port_\(computer_networking\)) for their online infrastructure as to avoid conventional [Internet scanning](/wiki/Port_scanner). PATN also uses up to three randomised [subdomains](/wiki/Subdomain) unique per exploit attempt as well as randomised [URL](/wiki/URL) paths.[1]

## Misuse

Although Pegasus is stated as intended to be used against criminals and terrorists,[8] use by authoritarian governments to spy on critics and opponents has often been reported. 

### Scandal in India

In late 2019, Facebook [initiated a suit](/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal) against NSO, claiming that Pegasus had been used to intercept the WhatsApp communications of a number of activists, journalists, and bureaucrats in India, leading to accusations that the Indian government was involved.[21][22][23]

Phone numbers of Indian ministers, opposition leaders and journalists were found on a database of NSO hacking targets by Project Pegasus in 2021.[24][25][26]

### Use by Mexican drug cartels

Reversing the intended use against criminals, Pegasus has been used to target and intimidate Mexican journalists by [drug cartels](/wiki/Drug_cartel) and cartel-entwined government actors.[27][28]

### Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi

Main article: [Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi](/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi)

Pegasus software, whose sales are licensed by the [Government of Israel](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel) to foreign governments, helped Saudi Arabia to spy on a Saudi dissident's smartphone and track his communication with journalist [Jamal Kashoggi](/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi), who was assassinated in 2018.[29]

### Project Pegasus revelations

Main article: [Project Pegasus revelations](/wiki/Project_Pegasus_revelations)

A leak of a list of over 50,000 phone number believed to have been identified as those of people of interest by clients of NSO since 2016 became available to Paris-based media nonprofit organisation [Forbidden Stories](/wiki/Forbidden_Stories) and [Amnesty International](/wiki/Amnesty_International). They shared the information with seventeen news media organisations in what has been called "Project Pegasus", and a months-long investigation was carried out, which reported from mid-July 2021. The Pegasus Project involved 80 journalists from the media partners: [The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian) (UK), [Le Monde](/wiki/Le_Monde) (France), [Die Zeit](/wiki/Die_Zeit) (Germany), [The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post) (USA), [Haaretz/TheMarker](/wiki/Haaretz) (Israel), [Süddeutsche Zeitung](/wiki/S%C3%BCddeutsche_Zeitung), [Aristegui Noticias](/wiki/Aristegui_Noticias), [Radio France](/wiki/Radio_France), [Proceso](/wiki/Proceso_\(magazine\)), [OCCRP](/wiki/OCCRP), [Knack](/wiki/Knack_\(magazine\)), [Le Soir](/wiki/Le_Soir), [The Wire](/wiki/The_Atlantic_Wire), Daraj,[30] [Direkt36](/w/index.php?title=Direkt36&action=edit&redlink=1) (Hungary),[31] and [PBS Frontline](/wiki/PBS_Frontline).[32] Evidence was found that many phones with numbers in the list had been targets of Pegasus spyware.[8]

## Vulnerabilities

Lookout provided details of the three iOS vulnerabilities:[14]

  * CVE-2016-4655: Information leak in kernel – A kernel base mapping vulnerability that leaks information to the attacker allowing them to calculate the kernel's location in memory.
  * CVE-2016-4656: Kernel memory corruption leads to jailbreak – 32 and 64 bit iOS kernel-level vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to secretly jailbreak the device and install surveillance software – details in reference.[33]
  * CVE-2016-4657: Memory corruption in the webkit – A vulnerability in the Safari WebKit that allows the attacker to compromise the device when the user clicks on a link.

As of July 2021, Pegasus likely uses many exploits, some not listed in the above [CVEs](/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).[1]

## Reactions

### News

News of the spyware received significant media attention,[18][34][35][36][37] particularly for being called the "most sophisticated" smartphone attack ever,[38][39] and, for being the first detection of a remote Apple jailbreak exploit.[40]

### NSO Group comment

Dan Tynant of _[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian)_ wrote an article that featured comments from NSO Group, where they stated that they provide "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime", although the Group told him that they had no knowledge of any incidents.[41]

### Bug-bounty program skepticism

In the aftermath of the news, critics asserted that Apple's bug-[bounty](/wiki/Bounty_\(reward\)) program, which rewards people for finding flaws in its software, might not have offered sufficient rewards to prevent exploits being sold on the [black market](/wiki/Black_market), rather than being reported back to Apple. Russell Brandom of _[The Verge](/wiki/The_Verge)_ commented that Apple's bug-bounty program, which rewards people who manage to find faults in its software, maxes out at payments of $200,000, "just a fraction of the millions that are regularly spent for iOS exploits on the black market". He goes on to ask why Apple doesn't "spend its way out of security vulnerabilities?", but also writes that "as soon as [the Pegasus] vulnerabilities were reported, Apple patched them—but there are plenty of other bugs left. While spyware companies see an exploit purchase as a one-time payout for years of access, Apple’s bounty has to be paid out every time a new vulnerability pops up." Brandom also wrote; "The same researchers participating in Apple’s bug bounty could make more money selling the same finds to an exploit broker." He concluded the article by writing; "It's hard to say how much damage might have been caused if Mansoor had clicked on the spyware link... The hope is that, when the next researcher finds the next bug, that thought matters more than the money."[42]

Earlier this month, an Emirati human rights activist named Ahmed Mansoor got a suspicious text. It promised new details of torture in the country’s state prisons, along with a link to follow if he was interested. If Mansoor had followed the link, it would have jailbroken his phone on the spot and implanted it with malware, capable of logging encrypted messages, activating the microphone and secretly tracking its movements.

The attack is detailed in [a new report from Citizen Lab and Lookout Security](https://citizenlab.org/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/), which received the link directly from Mansoor. The malware targets three previously undisclosed vulnerabilities in iOS, allowing for arbitrary code execution, access to kernel memory, and access to kernel privileges. When combined, those vulnerabilities allow for a remote jailbreak of an iOS device, a long sought-after capability that has never been previously observed in an active campaign.

On discovering the vulnerabilities, Citizen Lab and Lookout reported them to Apple, and fixes for the vulnerabilities have been patched with [today’s release of iOS 9.3.5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204).

Citizen Lab linked the attack to a private Israeli spyware company known as NSO group, although it’s unclear how the exploits were first discovered. Earlier this year, the exploit broker Zerodium offered and awarded a million-dollar bounty [for remote jailbreaking capability in iOS 9](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/21/9364827/ios-9-hack-bounty-one-million-dollars), which Citizen Lab notes is similar to the exploit used against Mansoor.

Apple [recently launched its own bug bounty](http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12380036/apple-bug-bounty-program-vulnerability-security) to encourage disclosure of such vulnerabilities. The highest bounty, up to $200,000, was offered for vulnerabilities that compromise the secure boot firmware.

The attack is likely to reignite the debate over private sector malware companies, which have drawn harsh criticism for selling intrusion software to [oppressive regimes in Uganda, Ethiopia, and Bahrain](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7861645/finfisher-spyware-let-bahrain-government-hack-political-activist).

Amnesty International — part of the group that helped break the news of journalists and [heads of state](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) being [targeted by NSO’s government-grade spyware, Pegasus](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation) — has [released a tool](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) to check if your phone has been affected. Alongside the tool is [a great set of instructions](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which should help you through the somewhat technical checking process. Using the tool involves backing up your phone to a separate computer and running a check on that backup. Read on if you’ve been side-eyeing your phone since the news broke and are looking for guidance on using Amnesty’s tool.

The first thing to note is the tool is command line or terminal based, so it will take either some amount of technical skill or a bit of patience to run. We try to cover a lot of what you need to know to get up and running here, but it’s something to know before jumping in.

It will take some amount of technical skill or a bit of patience

The second note is that the analysis Amnesty is running seems to work best for iOS devices. In its documentation, Amnesty says the analysis its tool can run on Android phone backups is limited, but the tool can still [check for potentially malicious](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/backup.html) SMS messages [and APKs](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/download_apks.html). Again, we recommend [following its instructions](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/methodology.html).

To check your iPhone, the easiest way to start is by making [an encrypted backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220) either [using iTunes or Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) on a Mac or PC. You’ll then need to locate that backup, which [Apple provides instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215) for. Linux users can follow [Amnesty’s instructions](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/backup/libimobiledevice.html) on how to use the libimobiledevice command line tool to create a backup.

## 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS: an electric S-Class with a 400-mile range

![](//img.connatix.com/b35d0149-24ea-487f-8985-472b4d2a5804/1_th.jpg?crop=396:223,smart&width=396&height=223&format=jpeg&quality=60&fit=crop)

The 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS is an electric S-Class sedan with over 400 miles of range and a massive 56-inch touchscreen. The interior is packed with luxuriantly appointed features, and ride quality is refined. But do we really need more luxury EVs?

* * *

After getting a backup of your phone, you’ll then need to download and install Amnesty’s mvt program, which Amnesty [also provides instructions](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for. 

If you’re using a Mac to run the check, you’ll first need to install both Xcode, which can be downloaded from the App Store, and Python3 before you can install and run mvt. The easiest way to obtain Python3 is using a [program called Homebrew](https://brew.sh), which can be installed and run from the Terminal. After installing these, you’ll be ready to run through [Amnesty’s iOS instructions](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/methodology.html).

You’ll want to make sure your iPhone’s backup is encrypted with a password

If you run into issues while trying to decrypt your backup, you’re not alone. The tool was giving me errors when I tried to point it to my backup, which was in the default folder. To solve this, I copied the backup folder from that default location into a folder on my desktop and pointed mvt to it. My command ended up looking like this:

_**(For illustration purposes only. Please use commands from Amnesty’s instructions, as it’s possible the program has been updated.)**_

> mvt-ios decrypt-backup -p PASSWORD -d decrypt ~/Desktop/bkp/orig 

When running the actual scan, you’ll want to point to an Indicators of Compromise file, which [Amnesty provides](https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2021-07-18_nso) in the form of a file called pegasus.stix2. Those who are brand-new to using the terminal may get tripped up on how to actually point to a file, but it’s relatively simple as long as you know where the file is. For beginners, I’d recommend downloading the stix2 file to your Mac’s Downloads folder. Then, when you get to the step where you’re actually running the check-backup command, add 

> -i ~/Downloads/pegasus.stix2

into the option section. For reference, my command ended up looking like this. (Again, this is for illustration purposes only. Trying to copy these commands and run them will result in an error):

> mvt-ios check-backup -o logs --iocs ~/Downloads/pegasus.stix2 ~/Desktop/bkp/decrypt

(For reference, the ~/ is more or less acting as a shortcut to your user folder, so you don’t have to add in something like /Users/mitchell.)

Again, I’d recommend following along with Amnesty’s instructions and using its commands, as it’s always possible that the tool will have been updated. Security researcher @RayRedacted on Twitter also has [a great thread](https://twitter.com/RayRedacted/status/1417829244869222400?s=20) going through some of the issues you may run into while running the tool and how to deal with them.

The investigation didn’t find evidence that US phones had been breached by Pegasus

As a final note, Amnesty only provides instructions for installing the tool on macOS and Linux systems. For those looking to run it on Windows, _The Verge_ has confirmed the tool can be used by [installing and using Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL) and following Amnesty’s Linux instructions. Using WSL will require downloading and installing a Linux distro, like Ubuntu, which will take some time. It can, however, be done while you wait for your phone to backup. 

After running mvt, you’ll see a list of warnings that either list suspicious files or behavior. It’s worth noting that a warning doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve been infected. For me, some redirects that were totally above board showed up in the section where it checked my Safari history (sheets.google.com redirecting to docs.google.com, reut.rs redirecting to reuters.com, etc). Likewise, I got a few errors, but only because the program was checking for apps that I don’t have installed on my phone. 

The story around Pegasus has likely left many of us regarding our phones with a bit more suspicion than usual, regardless of whether we’re likely to be targeted by a nation-state. While running the tool could (hopefully) help to ease some fears, it’s probably not a necessary precaution for many Americans. NSO Group has said its software cannot be used on phones with US numbers, [according to _The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/?itid=hp_alert), and the investigation didn’t find any evidence that US phones had been successfully breached by Pegasus. 

While it’s nice to see that Amnesty made this tool available with solid documentation, it only really helps to address the privacy concerns around Pegasus. As we’ve seen recently, it doesn’t take a government targeting your phone’s microphone and camera to get private information — the [data broker industry](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times) could be [selling your location history](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers) even if your phone is Pegasus-free.
