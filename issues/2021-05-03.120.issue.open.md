## This is an excerpt with commentary from a guest presentation during the iPad Pro unveiling at Apple's Fall 2015 special event.

It was, indeed, a relatively important one, as arguably the definitive moment leading to the relationship between Apple, Inc. and Microsoft constructing the context that makes first watch so crass. What I want to focus on, though, is the demonstrator. In the video, I said he wasn't named immediately before Kirk names him (just by first name, though.) Ashamedly, I struggled with the spelling of Han-yi - thank Gourd for [the transcript](https://singjupost.com/apple-special-event-september-9-2015-full-transcript/?singlepage=1). Once I had the spelling of his first name, I immediately found [**Han-yi Shaw on LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hashaw). 

I plan to do my best to get in contact with Han-yi about the discipline I saw in his touch interactions with iOS, if for no other interest than bettering my own use.

Han-Yi Shaw didn’t like what he saw, and he told Microsoft so. The software giant, by Shaw’s reckoning, didn’t really understand Apple’s platform or how to develop Office for it. Shaw told [Microsoft](https://mashable.com/category/microsoft/) exactly what he thought — and the company responded by agreeing to all of his changes, then hiring him.

That was more than a decade ago. Today, Shaw heads up Microsoft’s Office Design Studio and is the architect of one of the tech giant’s most important innovations in years: Office for iPad.

The product is available now in the App Store as three distinct apps: Word for iPad, Excel for iPad and PowerPoint for iPad. They are free to download, but you won’t get full functionality — such as being able to edit or create new documents — without an Office 365 subscription (which is $99 a year for five installs on mobile devices, plus another five installs on desktops and laptops).

In person, Shaw is enthusiastic and extremely organized. Of all the people I met with at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters to discuss the company’s latest iPad release, no one's desk or walls were more ordered than Shaw's. His awards were grouped together by type. Printouts of UI mockups for Office for iPad and worksheets were posted on a cork board in a near-perfect grid.

Shaw’s exacting nature and attention to detail are evident in iPad for Office. Despite working with a team of roughly 200 designers and developers, his fingerprints are all over the touch-friendly software.

“I used to tinker with ... even just the spacing between the elements," Shaw said. "When I hit the sweet spot, I give it to my team and they mass-produce it for all other parts of the product.”

“The details, they really do matter,” he explained.

For Shaw, who has always been obsessed with design, that was clearly something of a mantra. His team built these three Office for iPad apps from “the ground up.” 

## Not a port

![Julia White, General Manager, Office Marketing, said Office has a billion users around the world.](https://mondrian.mashable.com/wp-content%252Fuploads%252F2014%252F03%252FJulia_White.jpg%252Ffull-fit-in__950x534.jpg?signature=57_MB0ZIgTYJ2T84sSm7ro-dlm8=&source=http%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com)

Julia White, General Manager, Office Marketing, said Office has a billion users around the world.

Microsoft wanted to make it crystal clear that Office for iPad was not a stripped-down, ported version of the Office Suite. Nor is it simply an expansion of [Office for iPhone](https://mashable.com/2013/06/14/office-iphone-review/), which the company released last year.

Julia White, general manager of Office marketing, said they didn't “just take your Windows desktop client and jam it on a bunch of platforms.”

“From the very beginning, many years back, 

> the goal has always been we want the best experience on whatever device people using 

the goal has always been we want the best experience on whatever device people using," White added. 

That process has been years in the making. No one would reveal exactly how long Office for iPad was in development, though Shaw mentioned something about two years. (He later said he didn’t know how long they were working on it.)

Shaw does remember how he felt when he first saw the iPad in 2010. When the tablet first came out, he said he "absolutely” wondered what Office would look like on it; it was brand new device and a brand new opportunity. "Immediately I was thinking about how I could deliver an excellent experience,” Shaw said. 

## Build it

According to White, 1 billion people use Microsoft Office around the world. Increasingly, they work in non-homogenous environments, switching between devices and sometimes platforms as they work on one or more documents.

This is largely thanks to the cloud, which allows you to store files and documents on a third-party server like Microsoft’s [OneDrive](https://mashable.com/category/onedrive/) (formerly SkyDrive). The subscription-based Office 365 defaults to cloud storage, as will Office for iPad.

If cloud-based storage was a given on Office for iPad, virtually nothing else was. Shaw’s plan, after all, was to build from scratch and not add or remove features based on a desktop-version checklist. Instead of being daunted by the idea, Shaw relished it because they were able to design everything from the ground up, instead of actually bringing a past version into the future, he said.

"Because every pixel we drew is brand new, didn’t exist prior to this, 

> we were able to make sure we didn’t have any legacy imperfections to bring over. 

we were able to make sure we didn’t have any legacy imperfections to bring over. That was exciting, too." 

Of course, Shaw couldn’t actually build Office for iPad by himself, even if he wanted to. He had to convince the team that building it to his specifications was the right thing to do.

Shaw studied policy at Columbia University, but was always a designer at heart. He made his case with an image-heavy, text-light presentation that included a handful of stark photos. One showed a beautiful white home, with windows that not only added aesthetic appeal on the outside, but delivered light and design on the inside. In other words, the inside and outside worked together.

He contrasted this image with a picture of another home, a hodgepodge of parts and design. Shaw explained that Office could sometimes appear this way, especially “when you add on a bunch of features not envisioned from the beginning.”

That would not be Office for iPad’s fate. No feature would be added to the suite of apps simply because it existed in Office on another platform. Shaw’s team took a scenario-based approach, always thinking about how users would use the features and the apps on the iPad.

Next, Shaw showed the team of a pair of beautiful pair of wrought-iron balconies built on the exterior of a house, but without windows or doors to access them. Perhaps more striking was the pair of urinals built caddy-corner to each other. They both work, Shaw said — but who would use them?

Shaw’s last photo was the inside of an airplane cockpit. 

> “Office is sometimes associated with complexity and bloat, like an airplane cockpit," 

“Office is sometimes associated with complexity and bloat, like an airplane cockpit," he said. "Wanted to avoid that." 

But no one was saying that Office for iPad would be unrecognizable.

Michael Atalla, director of Microsoft's Office division, said that users will have a familiar experience when they open these apps. Word for iPad, for instance, offers an “unmistakably Word experience,” he said.

This was one of the chief challenges for Shaw.

“It was about finding the sweet spot between platform-appropriate and unmistakably Microsoft,” he said. But just how do you combine an iPad-friendly user interface with design that also adheres to Microsoft’s [Metro design principals](https://mashable.com/2012/03/29/microsoft-metro-is-a-philosophy/)?

![Michael Atalla, Director, Microsoft Office Division holds an iPad Air running Office for iPad.](https://mondrian.mashable.com/wp-content%252Fuploads%252F2014%252F03%252FMichael_Atalla.jpg%252Ffull-fit-in__950x534.jpg?signature=bzIOqrUJ5OacwfzhtoTeIdUFpbk=&source=http%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com)

At least partly, this meant bringing familiar Office interface metaphors, such as the Ribbon menu system, to the iPad, without making it seem like the very rich Ribbon available on the desktop version.

Office’s context-sensitive Ribbon is where virtually all of Office’s features and options reside. It’s quite deep, though Shaw acknowledged that 80% of Office users tap into just 20% of the application’s full feature set.

That should have made it easier for Shaw to deliver an iPad-friendly ribbon, but as Shaw said, that 20% can vary from user to user.

Still, Shaw had a lofty goal for the Ribbon on the iPad: 

> “While we’re bringing the ribbon over to the iPad, it will be no heavier than a feather.” 

“While we’re bringing the ribbon over to the iPad, it will be no heavier than a feather.” While the original Ribbon was built with a mouse and keyboard in mind, this one would have to be “touch-first and slate optimized,” Shaw said. 

In order to determine what would end up on the slimmed-down iPad Ribbon, Shaw's team studied data that told them which features Office customers used the most frequently.

Shaw believes they have nailed all the basics and key usage cases in this first release. But when I pointed out a few of my favorite features that were missing, like “paste transpose” in Excel and image-cropping in PowerPoint, he admitted they may not have encapsulated every scenario — but that there is a backlog of features.

White reminded me that Microsoft development cycles are not what they used to be, and in a good way. Office 365, for example, has seen 72 updates since its release. This means we could see, just as with any other iPad app, slipstream updates soon after Thursday’s launch. White believes this is a better experience for end users.

The old model often meant two years or more of development, followed by a big dump of new features. “It’s hard to consume three years of innovation [at once],” White said. Users just seem to prefer incremental updates. 

## No keyboard, no problem

A lot of the work in developing Office for iPad went into screen real estate issues. The iPad’s 9.7-inch screen is smaller than most laptop screens, and a lot smaller than desktop displays. It had to be designed without the option for an external keyboard or mouse and with the option of changing the orientation of the screen.

Shaw's team wondered about the best way to optimize to ensure keyboard and interface didn't collide. What do you do when there’s no mouse or concept of “hover over” to view a tooltip for instructions on an icon's purpose?

Without a mouse, you can't right-click. 

> How could Word for iPad exist without a right click? 

How could Word for iPad exist without a right click?

Shaw simply made things implicit. Touch becomes the right click. Where possible, labels describe what a menu or button will do. In others, a touch brings an action menu (calling it “drop-down” would not be quite accurate.)

Despite the familiar look and Shaw’s efforts to find a familiar and platform-correct middle ground, some changes might surprise Office users. For example, you won't find a “save” button on the menu by default. In Office for iPad, you start out with an autosave button.

But Shaw didn’t want to force Office users to “learn a third thing.” So when you turn off autosave, you'll find a big "save" button under the “file” icon.

Throughout a yearlong design and development process, Shaw tapped into user studies and focus groups to see whether his team was, in fact, building the tablet Office users wanted. They were trying to find that “sweet spot between reimagining and offering familiarity,” Shaw said. He was convinced they were on the right track; apparently, those in focus groups would try Office for iPad and ask “can I take this device home?” 

## What would Jobs do?

Despite working at Microsoft for 14 years, Shaw adheres to an ethos that echoes a couple of quotes from late Apple CEO and founder [Steve Jobs](https://mashable.com/category/steve-jobs/): “It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology is not enough” and "We’ve always tried to be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts.”

> Shaw said that the cross-section of design and liberal arts is what defines a successful product. 

Shaw said that the cross-section of design and liberal arts is what defines a successful product.

When Shaw first approached Microsoft in the late '90s with his ideas about how Office for Mac could work, he believed Microsoft was too heavily focused on the technology, rather than the way people were using the product. Mac users were, perhaps, less tech-savvy than their Windows counterparts, but no less interested in getting maximum benefit out of the product.

At the time, Shaw was a student studying policy, and he wrote hundreds of papers about the platform. His ideas were eventually baked into Office for Mac. His design and development philosophy has not changed much since those pre-touch-interface days. When it came to building Office for iPad, Shaw, like Jobs, cared deeply about how the product looked and fretted over virtually every pixel. He would sketch the designs and push pixels.

This is not inconsequential when you consider that the entire Office for iPad interface is Retina-display ready. Every icon and every screen object, even those that might resemble their counterparts on other platforms, were drawn with greater attention to detail than ever before.

Despite Shaw's obvious affinity for Apple products — an Apple display and MacBook sit in his office — he couldn't say much about what Apple thinks of Office for iPad. The Cupertino-based company is aware, though, and Shaw said Apple is "excited about it."

In the end, Microsoft may have the perfect vessel to deliver what appears to be a very polished first version of Office for iPad. When you hear Han-Yi Shaw speak, sometimes you hear echoes of both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

"These devices are magical," Shaw said, "but only so magical if you can get work done.”
