## Middle-of-the-Night Post in the Underunderstood Discord

totally let you guys down in falling behind… the only actual certification I hold is a Class C Missouri Underground Storage Tank Operator…

(I had to go to oil college for like 20 consecutive hours in order to intimately understand how ridiculously safe modern fuel dispensation is.) ((I worked in gas stations for ~5 years))

if there’s anything I can almost certainly dispel (within the U.S., anyway,) it’s that **gas stations definitely do not modify their pumps in any way.** they’re maintained by private (but state-certified) companies and inspected regularly by a Gas Elder who will legit stop everything if a pump is miscalibrated by degrees so minuscule you actually wouldn’t believe it.

infinitely many stories which I’m sure I, alone find actually interesting. 

missing my good old friends, *VEEDER-ROOT* and HϽ⊥IMS ƎH⊥.

if there’s one thing I can impart upon y’all, *you have nothing to fear from the nozzle*. do not worry about the pump, worry about spilled gasoline on the ground. if you can see a well-outlined spot, move to a different pump and make an attendant deal with it. you might even get to see them use *The Foam*!! (I *hate* The Foam)
