# Get Waxed
Unfortunately, I wasted these letters' best subject line yet on [this unfinished one](http://bit.ly/psalmswaxed), left two weeks ago when I ran out of adderall. It was a particularly fun and restful vacation, but I am once again pilled-up and Ready To Tweet. 

Another ("complete") letter will be headed your way soon, I'm sure, but in the interim, there's **the [first episode](http://bit.ly/rdadguns) of  [Runnin' Down a Dream](http://extratone.com/dream) to listen to!** (That's the show Eryn, Maddie, and have been planning to produce since Spring about our local shenanigans.)

And! Isiah's killed it once again with his hilarious [Yelp! bit](http://bit.ly/isiahyelp) that's currently gracing the frontpage.

I'll talk to ya soon.

The other night, I was a bit upset over some Very Old News, so Eryn took me driving (God bless,) and I said something really insightful, under the influence:

*What ends up important to you is a combination of what was important to your parents, what you never had, and what you couldn't have imagined.*
