## [Obsidian](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian-connected-notes/id1557175442)

Obsidian is out of beta and available on the App Store for iPhone and iPad users. For the first part of how Federico is using Obsidian for research and writing, don’t miss his Extension column above. At its core, Obsidian is a Markdown text editor. Just point the app to a folder on your iPhone or iPad and you’re ready to get started. The app is based on web technologies, which means it is highly customizable. Obsidian supports a theming system, with a wide variety of themes provided by the app’s vibrant community of users and plugins to extend the app’s functionality. The app’s primary views are its editor and preview mode, which can be split into multiple panes both vertically and horizontally. Obsidian also supports saved workspaces that allow users to open a predefined group of notes easily, commands for quickly opening documents and accessing the app’s features, along with extensive, customizable keyboard shortcut support. Of course, notes can be linked internally, allowing for the creation of a wiki-like web of documents. That’s just the tip of the iceberg, which you’ll be hearing more about from Federico here in his special Obsidian Setup series and elsewhere on MacStories.

## [Timery for Toggl](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544)

Timery is now available from your Mac’s menu bar. You can access your timers, edit them, stop running timers, start saved timers, and more, all from the menu bar. The elapsed time of your current timer can be displayed if you’d like with the option to have the seconds tick up, which I have turned off because minutes are plenty for my purposes. The Timery icon can also be tinted to match the project you’re working on, which is one of my favorite touches. I don’t usually like color in my menu bar, but the subtle splash of color is a nice reminder of whether you started the correct timer or not.

## [RainViewer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rainviewer-live-weather-radar/id980123924?uo=4)

RainViewer is a weather app with an emphasis on providing radar data, a wide array of widgets, and worldwide coverage. The latest update has a new precipitation direction feature that depicts which way precipitation is heading in real-time. If radar is an important aspect of your weather tracking, RainViewer is worth checking out.

## [Notebooks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notebooks-write-and-organize/id1490084838?uo=4)

Notebooks has been around for a long time, providing users with a long list of features for organizing notes, writing, and more across the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. Version 2.4 is out with improved iCloud Drive support, a Solarized UI theme, and the ability to use colored syntax highlighting when editing Markdown text. Mermaid Flowcharts syntax is also available in Markdown documents.

## [GoodTask](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-tasks/id1068039220?uo=4)

GoodTask was already one of the most customizable task managers around, [as Federico and I discussed on AppStories](https://appstories.net/episodes/231/) this week. With version 6.8, the customization options are even deeper. One of the main focuses in this update is how tasks are displayed. There’s a section in the app’s Settings that allows you to set different appearances for list and board views and tweak many aspects of how tasks are displayed, including where tags and dates appear. There are also new icon options and more context menus used throughout the app.

## [FitnessView](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitnessview/id1531983371?uo=4)

FitnessView is a new app for visualizing health and fitness data from the makers of WaterMinder, HabitMinder, and other apps. FitnessView starts with the familiar Activity ring metaphor Apple uses in its Fitness app but adds a series of customizable tiles that track goals you’ve set for yourself. Tapping on a tile opens a detailed view with historical data and insights into your progress. There’s also a separate section of recent workouts that can be expanded to see details about each. The app’s other tabs offer statistics for different time periods for your goals, more workout data, and settings. If you’re looking for a new way to view your health and fitness data and an easy way to set and track goals, FitnessView is an excellent new way to keep on top of it all.

## [Keystroke Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keystroke-pro/id1572206224?mt=12&uo=4)

One of the hardest things to follow when someone is sharing a screen over Zoom, or some other video service is what keystrokes they’re using. Keystroke Pro has a beautiful design that is reminiscent of mechanical keyboards. When activated, your keystrokes are displayed onscreen clearly for anyone viewing your screen. The style of the keystrokes is customizable, too, allowing users to pick something that fits with the app they’re using or their personal tastes.

## [AppSwitcher](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/appswitcher-clean-app-switch/id1575587195?mt=12&uo=4)

AppSwitcher is another app worth considering if you do a lot of screen sharing because it only displays the apps you are Command-tabbing between. That eliminates a lot of potential clutter. You won’t see the windows of other apps overlapping beneath the apps you’re switching between. AppSwitcher is a simple, single-purpose that does one thing very well and is worth checking out if you want to clean up what people see on your screen without closing apps you’re using.
